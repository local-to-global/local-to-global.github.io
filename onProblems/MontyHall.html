  Consider the following game:
  </p>
  <div class="thm">
  You are a constestant on a gameshow. You are presented with a wall containing three doors. Behind one of the doors is a prize, and behind the other two are goats. The host asks you to choose one of the doors, which you do. The host then opens one of the doors that you did not choose and reveals a goat. The prize is then either behind the door that you chose, or it is behind the remining unopened door. The host then gives you a choice: You can either keep the door you originally chose or change your choice to the remaining open door. Which choice should you make? Does it even matter?
  </div>
  <p>
  This is the Monty Hall problem, as this exact game was played on the Monty Hall Show. The correct choice to make is to switch doors. You will have a $1/3$rd chance of winning if you stay with the door that you have and a $2/3$ chance of winning if you swap. This result is unintuitive. So unintuitive that when it was first demonstrated, mathematicians did not believe it (partly because the person who proved it was a woman).
  </p>
  <p>
  Instead of directly addressing and analyzing the Monty Hall Game, let's look at a different game on a knock-off version of the show:
  </p>  
  <div class="thm">
  You are a constestant on a gameshow. You are presented with a wall containing three doors. Behind one of the doors is a prize, and behind the other two are goats. The host asks you to choose one of the doors, which you do. The host then gives you a choice of win-conditions: You can either choose to win if the prize is behind the door that you chose OR you can choose to win if the prize is behind any door that you did not choose. Which choice should you make? Does it even matter?
  </div>
  <p>
  Hopefully the solution to this problem is obvious: Choose to win if the prize is behind a door you did not choose. There are two possible places for the prize to be in this case, so you'll win two out of three times. The key insight is that this game is equivalent to the original Monty Hall Game!
  </p>
  <p>
  To see this, we need to understand that opening a losing door does not actually provide any new information. After selecting a door, you know that one of the remaining doors will have the prize and the other will not. When the door is opened, you still know this, with the unimportant detail of which door is which. Imagine that you jumped the gun when playing the game. You chose a door and before Monty could open one of the remaining doors, you went ahead and decided to switch your door. Monty would then open the losing door and attach your choice to the remaining door. But by making that choice early, you've decided to make your win condition be that you'll win if the prize is behind either of the doors that you did not choose. The order of these things does not matter, so these two games are equivalent. The structure of how the original game is presented then functions to obfuscate the nature of this choice.
  </p>
    <h4>Appendix: More detailed proof</h4>
    <p>
      The above argument is a fairly rigorous argument detailing why the situation is as it is, but we can use is to provide a more detailed proof. The claim is that the two games are essentially the same game. This means that identical results should come about from corresponding choices in each game. Call the original game Game $A$, and the modified game Game $B$.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let the game be setup with the prize behind some door, that we'll call Door $W$ and the other doors Door $L_1$ and Door $L_2$. In both games first assume that the player chooses a losing door, say, without loss of generality, Door $L_1$. If we're playing Game $A$, then the host will open Door $L_2$ and ask you to switch. You'll win if you decide to switch. If we're playing Game $B$, then the host will just ask if you'd prefer to win if the prize is not behind $L_1$.  In this case, you'll win if you choose this condition. Therefore, in the case that you initiall choose a losing door, you'll win if you make one of these corresponding choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assume that you initially choose Door $W$. During Game $A$, the host will open, randomly, one of the remainig doors, say Door $L_1$. You'll then lose if you choose to switch your door choice. If you are playing Game $B$, then you'll lose if you choose the winning condition with two doors. Therefore, the outcome will be the same based on these corresponding choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reasoning demonstrates that the games are identical up to presentation. Therefore, computations in one apply to computations in the other. Since the probability of winning is $2/3$ in Game $B$ if you choose the winning condition with more doors, it follows that the probability of winning is $2/3$ in Game $A$ if you choose the corresponding choice of chosing to swap doors.
