   <p>Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is a wild ride. But even after going to the ends of the earth to get Wiles' main result, there's one last hoop to jump through before we can actually finish the work. This hoop is know as the 3-5 Switch and is, in and of itself, pretty interesting. In this article, I'll try to explain how this last trick actually works and why it is cool. I want to keep everything as simple and easy to read as possible, so I will not be going much into depth as the focus will be the big ideas.
   </p>
   <h3>The Setup</h3>
   <p>
   The main objects of interest in Wiles' proof are rational Elliptic Curves. The temptation for something like this is to offer clear introductions to the objects involved and a careful explanation of how everything works but even if you lay out everything very clearly then, unless you have experience with these objects, it's just going to be a bunch of jargon; meaningless nouns preceeded by a zoo of equally meaningless adjectives. I will, then, forgo the formalities. Instead of Elliptic Curves, we'll be thinking of pictures, like those on your computer.

   <p>
   A picture can be of a mountain, a field, a church, or of people. Pictures can be outlines, black-and-white, or colorful. With our new wording, a key result obtained was that Fermat's Last Theorem is true if we can show that all Pictures of People are colorful. And this is what Wiles proved. The actual main result, with the bulk of the work, was showing that if a Picture of People was not just an outline, then it was colorful
