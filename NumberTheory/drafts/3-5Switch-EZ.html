   <p>Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is a wild ride. But even after going to the ends of the earth to get Wiles' main result, there's one last hoop to jump through before we can actually finish the work. This hoop is know as the 3-5 Switch and is, in and of itself, pretty interesting. In this article, I'll try to explain how this last trick actually works and why it is cool. I want to keep everything as simple and easy to read as possible, so I will not be going much into depth as the focus will be the big ideas.
   </p>
   <h3>The Setup</h3>
   <p>
   The main objects of interest in Wiles' proof are rational Elliptic Curves. In order to describe exactly how Elliptic Curves are used, we would need to introduce a lot of terminology which would, unfortunately, distract from exploring the 3-5 Switch. So I'm not going to explain them, because the interesting thing is not what these terms mean, but how they fit together. Instead, I'll just label them using letters in a way that, at least moderately flows with the logic. Here's a quick list of these labels and what they stand for. If it's all gibberish, then that's totally cool.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>$S$ - Semistable</li>
      <li>$m_p$ - The mod $p$ Galois representation for the curve is modular</li>
      <li> $M$ - Modular</li>
      <li> $I$ - Irreducible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The main statement that Wiles was trying to prove was that if $E$ was a rational elliptic curve with property $S$ then $E$ was had property $M$. This would prove Fermat's Last Theorem. In equation form:
      $$
      \Big( (E+S)\doublerightarrow (E+M)\Big) \doublerightarrow \textrm{FLT}
      $$
      The main result that Wiles proved was that if $E$ had property $S$ and there was some prime $p$ so that $E$ also had property $m_p$, then $E$ was $M$. In equation form:
      $$
      (E+S+m_p) \doublerightarrow (E+M)
      $$
      After this huge, huge step was finished, he still had more to do. He had to show that for every $E$ with property $S$, there was some prime $p$ so that $E$ also had $m_p$. That is, he needed to prove:
      $$
      (E+S) \doublerightarrow (\exists p\;\; E+m_p)
      $$
      This will be where we pick-up the proof.
