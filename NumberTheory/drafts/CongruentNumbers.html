    <p><i> A <b>Congruent Number</b> is an integer that is the area of a triangle that has sides of rational length. It is a hard problem to determine whether or not a number is a congruent number or not. In the 80s, Cassels used the modularity of a certain class of elliptic curves to provide a criteria that can tell if a number is congruent. Assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, this becomes a criteria that can tell if a number is not congruent. We will look at how this criteria works and the connection it has with modularity and the BSD conjecture.</i></p>
