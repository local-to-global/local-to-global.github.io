    <p>Chebyshev's Bias is an apparent preference amoung primes. The basic example works as follows: Go along the number line and sort the primes into one of two boxes. Sort the prime $p$ into Box A if the remainder of $p$ after dividing by $4$ is $1$. Sort the prime into Box B if the remainder of $p$ after dividing by $4$ is $3$. These are the only two options for remainders of odd primes.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have an important theorem, called Dirichlet's Theorem on Primes in Arithmetic Progression, which says that the boxes will have the same "proportion" of primes in them when this process is "finished". Half of the primes will be in Box A and half of the primes will be in Box B. If we track which box has more primes in it as we go along, then, since Dirichlet's Theorem says that there's no overall preference, we should be able to conclude that Box A will have more primes in it half of the time and Box B will have more primes in it the other half of the time.

      But we don't see this. What we find is that Box B is in the lead $99.59\%$ of the time. If we view this as a race, then Racer B is the favored runner. The race may end as a tie, but Racer B leads almost the entire race. Really, the race ends in an upset due to the preference given to Racer B. The graph below gives the (weighted) number of primes in each box up to the x-value of the graph:

  Why do this happen? This goes against our intuition because primes should behave randomly, and this result is a clear preference among primes. Particularly, there should be an arithmetic explanation of this statistical anomoly.
  </p>
  <p>
  We need to get a better understanding of this situation and to do so can look at a more general formulation of Chebyshev's Bias. If $q$ is a number, then there are two types of remainders after dividing by $q$: Quadratic Residues and Non-residues. A remainder $r$ is a quadratic residue if there is some number $x$ so that $x^2$ divided by $q$ has remainder $r$. A non-residue is a remainder that is not a quadratic residue. So, given $q$, we have two buckets: Residues and Non-residues. For $q=4$ the residues are exactly $0$ and $1$, whereas the non-residues are $2$ and $3$, which correspond to Box A and Box B respectively. The general Chebyshev's Bias says that if we do this sorting process while by dividing by $q$, then, most of the time, the non-residue bucket will have more primes in it than the residue bucket. For some reason, there is a preference towards non-residues.   This gives us an arithmetic connection, as primes prefer to not be equivalent to a square after division.

    The next thing that we can do is look towards the proof of Chebyshev's Bias to see if we can understand why primes might do this. One thing to understand about results like Chebyshev's Bias, which are part of the field of Analytic Number Theory, is that we obtain theorems by taking advantage of some nice analytic property of well-behaved functions that are constructed to encode the information we're interested in. Oftentimes, during this construction process, it is not productive to limit our focus to just the primes. The set of primes is too particular and don't interact well with our construction processes. Instead, we smooth out the primes by including prime-powers as well. So instead of the set
    $$
  2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,...
  $$    
  we look at the numbers
  $$
  2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16,17,19,...
  $$
    This enlarged set of numbers is much more well behaved, and this allows for the construction of the nice functions that we can the use analytic techniques to extract results from. This is usually not an issue because higher powers of primes are much more rare than primes, which means that they usually don't contribute much if anything to the end result. So if we're going for a particular result, we'll show that the corresponding result is true about prime powers and then show that the contribution of prime powers is insignificant, allowing us to make the conclusion about primes. This is how the Prime Number Theorem and Dirichlet's Theorem work. But usually it is the asymptotic nature of these results that allows us to exclude prime powers. That is, prime powers contribute <i>something</i> to results, but this contribution gets less and less the further along the number line we go, allowing us to exclude them asymptotically. But Chebyshev's Bias is looking at what is happening as we go along the number line, not what happens at the end, so prime powers are going to make a nontrivial contribution to the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      How does including prime powers, then, affect our sorting process? Well, if we do include the prime powers into this sorting process, sorting $p^n$ into either Box A or Box B depending on whether or not its remainder after dividing by $q$ is a quartatic residue, then we actually prove that the preference is gone! That is, Box A will be in the lead half of the time and Box B will be in the lead the other half of the time. This means that there is no Chebyshev Bias for prime powers! This is illustrated by the graph below, where you can see a swapping of the lead very frequently:

    <p>
      It is this unbiasedness of the prime powers, along with arithmetic considerations, that produces Chebyshev's bias. The important hting to note is that for any prime $p$ the prime power $p^2$ will <i>always</i> get sorted into Box A. As will every $p^4$, $p^6$, etc, etc (although, powers larger than $2$ don't contribute much even to this process). Box A corresponds to remainderst that are remainders of squares, and these are all squares, so they go into Box A. This means that there are a lot of numbers going into Box A by default (thanks to arithmetic considerations). Since the situation wants to keep Boxes A and B even among prime powers, it follows that there are going to have to be a lot of primes going into Box B. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, really, Chebyshev's Bias isn't really a bias, its a process that must be done in order to balance out and preserve non-bias!
