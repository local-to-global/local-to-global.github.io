  Projective Geometry extends classical geometry. In this process it unifies some ideas, and gives us more flexibility in others. As we'll see, it allows us to do things like divide by zero, it tells us that all conics are just different ways to look at the same object, and gives us a way to count how many times two algebraic equations intersect. We'll just look at the one and two dimensional cases over the real numbers, but these ideas extend all over math and put a lot of things in a much more unified and compact setting.

  <h3>The Real Line and Infinity</h3>
  <p>
  Anyone who passed middle school knows that you can't divide by zero. Anyone, that is, except mathematicians, we divide by zero all over the place. But how does this work? Heuristically, we want to say that $\frac{1}{0}=\infty$. This is actually fine, as long as you're willing to put up with a few extra rules for arithmetic, we'll make it an precise concept that can be generalized in a bit. But with just this we can figure out a bit about how it needs to behave.</p>
  <p>
  Firstly, this infinity is different than the infinity you see in calculus. Note that 
  $$
  -\infty = \frac{-1}{0} = \frac{1}{-0} = \frac{1}{0} = \infty
  $$
    which means that $-\infty=\infty$. In particular, note that this is a direct consequence of the fact that $0=-0$. So, arithmetically, separating $-\infty$ and $\infty$ makes as much sense as separating $0$ and $-0$. This also gives us a hint at what the geometric interpretation of infinity is, in this case. If you'll recall, if we plug in very small positive numbers for $x$ into $1/x$, then we get out very large positive numbers and if we plug in very small negative numbers into $1/x$, then we get out very large negative numbers. So as the $x$ in $1/x$ goes to zero from the positive side, you travel along the real line out to $\infty$ and as the $x$ in $1/x$ goes to zero from the negative side, you travel along the real line out to $-\infty$. If $x$ is really small, then it looks like $1/x$ is travelling away from $1/-x$ really fast, eventually ending up so that one is at $\infty$ and the other is at $-\infty$:

<p>
 But in our interpretation $-\infty=\infty$, which means that as $x$ goes to zero, the values $1/x$ and $1/-x$ are now travelling to the same point! Even though they're travelling away from each other along the real line, they're travelling towards each other when we include $\infty=1/0$. The only way that this can happen is if, through this new point, the real line actually loops back onto itself and forms a circle:

<p>
This is what the Projective Real Line is. It is the real line tied up into a circle using an extra point called "infinity". We can compare this to what is used in Calculus, which is the "Extended Real Line", which is the real line capped off on either end with two new points, $-\infty$ and $\infty$. You can get from the Extended Real Line to the Projective Real Line by gluing those two points together. Overall, then, if we define $\infty$ arithmetically as $1/0$, then this forces us to interpret it as living on this circle, the Projective Real Line. We can extend some more of the arithmetic operations to include infinity, here $x$ is any real number (not infinity) and $y$ is any real number (possibly infinity, but not zero):
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
y\cdot\infty = \infty &&\\ 
 \frac{x}{\infty}=0 &&\\
x+\infty=\infty && 
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
We still have some undefined quantities, like $0\cdot\infty$, $\infty/\infty$, $0/0$, $\infty-\infty$. You'll note the similarity to the indeterminant forms for L'Hopital's rule. These prevent us from doing a few things that we would normally do with arithmetic. Most notably, these rules, along with the restriction, prevent us from using division by zero to "cancel". For example, $2\cdot0=3\cdot0$, but we can't divide by $0$ to cancel out the zeros, as we would end up with $2=3$. This is how a lot of "fake proofs" of rediculous things of this sort work. This is all because $x0=0$ for all $x$ and $y\infty=\infty$ for all $y$. So while we can divide by zero now, we can't cancel using this division. This is perhaps why you don't see it in school. Division isn't taught super well, the computational process is taught okay, but the arithmetic concepts are not, so it would be hard to instill onto students the difference between division and cancellation.

<h3>The Projective Real Line</h3>
<p> What we have just described is an intuitive idea about how we would expect something like division by zero to work. But this does not mean that we have created a mathematically precise method for dealing with it. This is a starting point for creating a mathematical formulation that encapsulates this intuition, and from this formulation we can generalize further to things like higher dimensions and alternate number systems.
</p>
<p>To make this formulation, we have to try to pick out the important things about the above description. What we found is that something like "$1/0$" can make sense, but the issue is that we cannot evaluate such a fraction. It's not the fraction itself that's the issue, the issue that fractions need to evaluate to real numbers that is the problem. This suggests that if we can work with fractions without having to worry if their division makes sense, then we might be able to get a way to get the fraction $1/0$. With this in mind, we can introduce Numerator-Denominator Pairs. These are nothing more than pairs of real numbers $(a:b)$ to represent the fraction $a/b$. We know that there is no context that can make $0/0$ make sense so we require at least one of the entries in the pair to be non-zero. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from evaluation, we want these pairs to behave like fractions. One thing about fractions is that we can cancel out common terms, that is
      $$
      \frac{ra}{rb} = \frac{a}{b}
      $$
    This suggests that we should have a similar thing happen to these pairs. That is, we impose the following equality:
      $$
      (ra:rb) = (a:b)
      $$
      whenever $r$ is a nonzero real number. Furthermore, fractions have their own rules for arithmetic:
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      \frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} &=& \frac{ad+bc}{bd}\\
      \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} &=& \frac{ac}{bd}\\
      \frac{a}{b} \ \frac{c}{d} &=& \frac{ad}{bc}\\
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      which suggests that we give our pairs an arithmetic as:
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      (a:b)+(c:d) &=& (ad+bc:bd)\\
      (a:b) \cdot (c:d) &=& (ac:bd)\\
      (a:b) / (c:d) &=& (ad:bc)
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      The set of all such pairs is called the "Projective Real Line". Within it, the Projective Real Line contains all the real numbers, the real number $r$ corresponds to the Projective Real Number $(r:1)$. But, in addition, we have things like $(a:0)$, which represent what would be $a/0$. Using our rules for arithmetic, we can show that 
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      (a:0) &=& (1:0)\\
      (1:0)\cdot(a:b) &=& (1:0)\\
      (a:b) / (0:1) &=& (1:0)\\
      (a:b) / (1:0) &=& (0:1)\\
      (1:0) + (a:b) &=& (1:0)
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      whenever $a$ is nonzero (and $b$ is nonzero in the last one). In this,  $(1:0)$ corresponds to $\infty$. These are the rigorous manifestation of $x\infty=\infty$, $x/0=\infty$, $x/\infty=0$ and $\infty + x =\infty$, except now we have a rigorous setting to investigate these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arithmetically, the Projective Real Line gives us an "infinity" and "division by zero" that makes rigorous sense. Geometrically, it looks like a circle. The most natural way to see this is to plot a point $(a:b)$ on the coordinate grid, and plot all the others that equal it. So all the points $(ra:rb)$. What you'll get is a line passing through the origin. This means that every point on the projective real line corresponds to a line in the plane. Conversely, every line corresponds to a point on the Projective Real Line, with the vertical line representing infinity. In a way, then, the Projective Real Line is the set of all slopes that lines can have. This is a lot, but luckily we can visualize this by drawing a circle around the origin and looking at the points where each line pass through the circle. This is close to how the Projective Real Line looks like a circle, but any line will pass through such a circle at two opposite points. So for every point on the Projective Real Line, we can easily get two points on the circle. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the point $(1:0)$, which represents infinity, corresponds to the top and bottom points on the circle. The point $(0:1)$, which represents zero, corresponds to the leftmost and rightmost points. The point $(1:1)$ corresponds to a line of 45 degrees and cuts through at two points. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We can easily turn these two points into a single point by wrapping the circle around itself twice, like you might double-loop a rubber band. If you imagine taking the bottom of the circle, and stretchcing it around the rest of the circle so that is meets with the top point, then you have the idea how this works. With this double looping, infinity corresponds to the top point, zero corresponds to the bottom point, 1 corresponds to the rightmost point and -1 corresponds to the leftmost point.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Using our intuition about what division by zero should look like, we've created a mathematically rigorous way to work with it. This formulation, the Projective Real Line, is very robust and can give us a blueprint to working in higher dimensions and in alternative number systems. For instance, we'll see that we can look at plane-geometry using infinities in the form of triples $(a:b:c)$ with similar equality conditions. With this we can say things like "All lines cross at one point in the Real Projective Plane, parallel lines cross at infinity". Conics have a very nice interpretation when we let them live on the Real Projective Plane, rather than just the Cartesian coordinate grid. While we have a nice formulation for this, we cannot visualize the Real Projective Plane. We can also take this idea and apply it to complex number as well, obtaining the Riemann Sphere, which is the Complex Projective Line.
