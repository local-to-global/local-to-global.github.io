  To understand relativity, and all the cool stuff like Black Holes and Gravitiational Waves, you really need to know what relativity is and why it is needed. And to know this, you need to understand a little bit of background in physics. In this article, we'll talk a little about the history leading up to Special Relativity and what Special Relaltivity says.
  <h3>Historical Context</h3>
  <p>In the late 1600s, Newton gave the first solid, complete mathematical description of the basic mechanics of motion. Using his framework, if you know the forces that act on an object, you could, in principle, figure out exactly what will happen to the object. This was codified in Newton's Laws, which are simple enough that their principles can be taught to students, but can be expressed robustly in terms of mathematics, allowing us to actually use them. This was very successful, and was used to describe many things, ranging from the motion of the planets to oscillatory motion of springs and more. Over the next ~200 years, his mechanics would be dissected and coelesse with other theories that say the same thing, but are more attractive mathematically, to form the field of Classical Mechanics. Classical Mechanics is the mathematical framework to describe the motion of objects, as motion is traditionally understood. Importantly, Classical Mechanics doesn't tell us  how forces act, or how they work, it just tells us what will happen once we know all the forces involved. </p>
  
  <p>
  Contrasting this, the theory of Electromagnetism was developed by people like Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-1800s. This theory described the behavior and interaction of the electric and magnetic forces. If we know how electric charge is configured, and what its motion is, then we can use the theory of Electromagnetism to figure out what the resulting electromagnetic forces will be. This, together with Classical Mechanics, can be used to predict how charged particles will move. The theory of Electromagnetism tells us what the forces do, and Classical Mechanics tells us what the particles will do, and there is a kind of feedback between them (since the electromagentic field will  change based on how the particles move and vice versa).</p>
  <p>Electromagnetism is a great success and predicted many different things, in particular it gave us an understanding about the nature of light. Light is what happens when you try to find a solution to Maxwell's equations in the absence of any electric charge. The result of this is a wave in the electromagnetic fields. This is, essentially, a back-and-forth between the electic and magnetic fields that propegates itself through space.</p>
  
  <p>Both Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism are extremely powerful theories, with a lot of interesting physics, and math, going into them. Careers have been made, even today, by studying the physics behind these theories and by studying the math behind them. But there are a few issues when you try to mix them. Electromagnetism is supposed to tells us how the electric and magnetic forces and fields behave, and then we should be able to use Classical Mechanics to see how particles will move in the presence of these fields. But you can setup legitimate situations where the interaction between these two theories result in contradictory conclusions. These contradictions generally happen when you setup a theoretical experiement, and see what happens to the involved objects when you look at them without moving, and then look at it again while you're moving relative to the experiment. What happens is that the experiment does different things based on how fast you're moving when you look at it. Obviously this doesn't make much sense, as what happens is what happens, and it shouldn't depend on how fast you're going when you look at it.</p>
  
  <p> There were attempts to solve these problems, most notably with the Lumineferous Aether. This was the theory that there was a medium through which light propegated, like waves in the ocean propegate through water. Famously, this theory was proved wrong through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">Michelson-Morely Experiment</a>, using Interferometers, experimental objects that come into play later in the theory of relativity. Overall, the mix of Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism predicts that there is a universal frame of rest for the entire universe, and that movement is always relative to this one particular frame. The Aether Theory was an attempt at replacing this absolute frame of reference with just a reference medium that light propegates through. The Michelson-Morely Experiment proved that both of these assertions were false. Light does not respect an absolute frame of reference, so there is no "absolute rest" in the universe, or an absolute medium that light propegates through.</p>
  
  <p>Where we're at at the end of the 1800s is with two really powerful theories, one of motion and one of electromagnetism, that do not combine. At least one of these theories needs to be modified to get rid of these contradictions</p>
  
  <h3>The Solution: Special Relativity</h3>
  <p> In 1905, Albert Einstein published three papers, each of which revolutionized three different fields in the process. In one, he used statistics to describe the motion of particles in a solution, essentially proving that atoms and molecules were a thing and that Thermodynamics could be described using statistics, validating the theory that Boltzmann had put forth (who would later commit suicide because he was ostricized for these theories, and never saw Einstein's paper). The second paper provided a mathematical framework for a certain quirk of light energizing electrons on sheets of metal, that showed that the way electrons absorbed energy was not continuous, but rather quantized. This was the first real look into Quantum Mechanics.</p>
  <p>Einstein's third paper solved the above problems resulting from the mix of Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism. The issues always popped up when your speed moved relative to a light particle, affecting your observation of the speed that this light particle was moving.  So instead of saying that there was an absolute frame or medium through which light moved, Einstein said that there was an absolute speed at which light moved. He said that, if you and your friend are measuring the speed of the same particl of light, but you're in a jet moving relative to your friend, then you both will agree on how fast the light particle is moving. This is directly contradictory to our intuition. If I'm moving at the speed of a bullet relative to you, and you shoot a gun right as I pass by you, then you'll say that the bullet is moving at the speed of a bullet, but I will  way that the bullet is not moving at all! The situation is completely different for light, we'll always agree that light moves at the speed of light.</p>
    
<p> To make this work out, mathematically, we have to change what we mean when we change frames of reference. Traditionally, to say that a frame of reference is moving, we just point in the direction its moving and send it off at some speed. We change the speed of its spacial coordinates, but we don't change the speed of its time. But this is what is needed if we want light to remain the same speed regardless of what frame we look at it from. In particular, if a frame is moving relative to me, then its time must be moving slower. This is the only way that we can preserve the absolute speed of light. What this means is that if I time you going from the start to finish in a race, and you time yourself going from start to finish, then your measured time will be less than my measured time. (Of course, this only matters if you are moving close to the speed of light relative to me.)
    </p>
    <p>One way to think about what is happening is that every frame of reference is moving at the same speed, the speed of light, always. It's just that it is moving through 4-dimensional space+time, so being at rest, spacially, means that you are moving at the speed of light pointing directly in the time direction. But if you are moving relative to me, then I'll see your direction of motion pointing a little bit into the spacial directions, since you're moving at the speed of light in 4D-spacetime, this means that your speed in the time direction is a little bit less, which means your time moves slower relative to me.</p>
    <p>
      This is what Special Relativity says. It take Classical Mechanics and changes what it means to be in a different frame of reference. When you apply this alternative notion of relative motion, this 4D-minded motion, to the equations in Electromagnetism, then all those paradoxes disappear. There is suddenly nothing wrong with electromagnetism. But this has some unintuitive consequences. We've already mentioned that time slows down for people in relative motion, but also the lengths of things in relative motion shrink. Furthermore, we lose the notion of simultaneity. If I see two things happen at the same time, then you won't agree with me if you're moving relative to me, you'll see them happen one before the other. Surprisingly, none of this produces any real paradoxes, they're just unintuitive.
    </p>
    <h3>Viewing things in 4-Dimensions</h3>
    <p>Not literally picturing things in 4D (that's impossible), but Special Relativity tells us that we need to understand quantities as being 4-dimensional objects rather than 3-dimensional objects.</p> 
    
    <h4>Four-Momentum</h4>
    <p>For example, typically if something is moving then we talk about its momentum. Momentum encapsulates information about how massive it is, how fast its moving and in what direction it's going. Generally, the higher the momentum, the more energy is required to stop it, and you need to push in the direction opposite of where the momentum is pointing. In particular, momentum has 3-components, telling us how much momentum is pointing in each of the 3-dimensions. But this is a 3D-notion of momentum, we need a 4D-notion of momentum. What is missing is a "time" component of momentum, that is, how much of its momentum is pointing in the "time" direction. This time component is propotional to the total energy that the particle has, which means that energy is the time component of momentum, when viewing it as a 4D object. We call this the Four-Momentum</p>
    <p>Importantly, we can look at the "magnitude" of this Four-Momentum. If we view it as a 4D arrow pointing off in 4D-dimensional spacetime, then we can figure out the "length" of it (I put "length" and "magnitude" in quotes, because it's not a length in the traditional notion of the concept, but plays the same role). The amazing thing is that the length is always the same, regardless of the frame of reference we view it from. This is different from the Classical Mechanics case, where you can change the momentum of an object based on how fast you move relative to it. In Special Relativity, changing your speed relative to a moving object, just changes how much the Four-Momentum points in the spacial directions and how much it points in the time direction. We can write an equation expressing the "length" of the Four-Momentum as:
      $$
      -\frac{E^2}{c^2} + p^2 = -m^2c^2
      $$
  The left side of this equation is the length of the Four-Momentum based on its time component ($E/c$) and the length of its spacial component $p$. Here $p$ represents what we would normally understand as how much total momentum an object has. The right side of this equation then tells us how long the Four-Momentum is, and regardless of what $E$ and $p$ are, it must always be $-m^2c^2$, the only thing that can change is how much is in $E$ and how much is in $p$ (note that this "length" is negative, which can't happen for traditional notions of length, this is different though). So regardless of how much spacial momentum and time momentum an object has, the "magnitude" of its Four-Momentum must be $-m^2c^2$. What happens if we change to a frame where the object has zero spacial momentum, which means $p=0$ and it is at rest. This equation then becomes, after rearranging things a bit,
      $$
      E=mc^2
      $$
  Which is Einstein's famous equation. This is just a special case of the original equation and is a consequence of the fact that the Four-Momentum does not change in "magnitude" when you change your frame of reference. This equation can also be used to talk about the "momentum of light". Traditionally, light has no momentum, because it has no mass, but relativistically, we find that only the total "magnitude" of the momentum  has to be zero, but this doesn't mean that the Four-Momentum itself has to be zero. In particular, we find that the momentum of light is
      $$
      p=E/c
      $$
      where $E$ is how much energy it has, which is dependent on the frequency (or color) of the light. 
      </p>
    <p> Finally, it is this equation that allows us to talk about how our speed through 4D-spacetime is always the speed of light. This is because momentum is, intuitively, just our speed multiplied by our mass. If $P$ is the Four-Momentum of something of mass $m$, then $P/m$ can be thought of as the velocity of the object, and the length of this is then our speed. The above equation then says that the (absolute value of the) length of $P/m$ is always $c$, which means that the speed of everything is always $c$. How fast you move through space is then determined by how much this momentum is pointing in the space dimensions. This is actually just a restatement of Einstein's $E=mc^2$. The actual propotion of space-speed to time-speed is a little more subtle, but this intuition is correct.
    <h4> Electromagnetism</h4>
    <p>
      Just as momentum and energy are tied up in a single 4D-object as the Four-Momentum, when we look at things in terms of special relativity, the electric fields and magnetic fields get tied up into a single 4D-object called the Electromagnetic Tensor. Classically, the electric field is different from the magnetic field, though they interact through Maxwell's Equations. In Special Relativity, they become a single thing, of which the electric and magnetic fields are just different parts. Further, as you change frames of reference, you "rotate" some of the electric field into the magnetic field and vice verse, showing that whether or not you see a magnetic or electric field depends on how you look at it, but the overall interactions that you see will be the same. This is the triumph of Special Relativity. While electric fields may turn into magnetic fields based on how you move in Classical mechanics, you get different interactions based on how these work. Special Relativity fixed that.
    </p>
    <h3>The Speed of Light</h3>
    <p> Firstly, travelling at the speed of light is impossible. The entire concept of a frame of reference moving at the speed of light is degenerate. If you try to use Einstein's equations for a frame of reference to get a frame that moves at the speed of light, you mess everything up. At this extreme case, you find that time does not travel, and that all distances shrink to zero. You can't talk about looking at something from the point of view of a photon, because, to a photon, it is created and destroyed at the same time and at the same place. There's no point of view to have! Furthermore, to  get to the speed of light, it requires and infinite amount of eneregy. Even if you constantly accellerate forever, all you'll do is asymptotically approach the speed of light, rather than ever getting to it. This is because acceleration works differently in relativity, constant acceleration no longer means a constant increase in speed.</p>
    <p>
      Next, certain physical quantities now depend on the frame you observe it in. Notably the total energy and total mass depend on how fast the object you're measuring is moving. The faster the speed, the more total energy and total mass and these quantities approach infinity as the speed approaches the speed of light. This is another barrier to something moving at the speed of light. In fact, only massless particles can move at the speed of light, and they have to.
    </p>
    <p>Another interesting property that changes based on how fast things are going is the color of light. While the rate at which light travels does not change when you change how fast you're moving, something has to change since light has energy and this energy needs change when you change your speed. To do this, if you move towards wherever the light is coming from, tinstead of the light seeming to increase speed, it will increase its energy by shortening its wavelength, which means it shifts more blue than it normally would. Contrasting this, if you move away from something, instead of the light speed decreasing, the energy will by lengthening the wavelength, making it more "red". This is akin to the change in pitch of a siren on an ambulance as it passes, when it is coming towards you, it is a higher pitch and as it travels away, it is a lower pitch. We can use this to determine how fast things are moving relative to us. Most important is probably figuring out how fast galaxies are moving relative to us. We know that galaxies are mostly made of hydrogen, and light coming from hydrogen has a very specific signiture in its color (called its "Spectrum"). When a galaxy is moving away from us, we see this spectrum shifted more red, and when it is moving towards us we see it shifted more blue, so we can figure out velocity this way. In general, galaxies move away from us, and the further they are from us, the faster they're travelling away. But this is more related to General Relativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, an important consequence of all this is that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This means that two things separated by some distance cannot affect each other faster than light can travel between them. Speed of light communication is the fastest possible. 
    </p>
      
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This is a few concepts about Special Relativity that are important to understand it and to talk about General Relativity. The interaction between Special Relativity and General Relativity is akin to the relationship between flat Euclidean geometry and the curved surface of the Earth. When you zoom in close to  the Earth, you can pretend that everything is flat, but once you zoom out it no longer works. But, you can obtain all the information about the curved Earth by patching together a bunch of flat maps from an atlas. Special Relativity tells us that space and time should be thought of as pieces of the same whole. General Relativity says that Special Relativity is the easy, flat version of this larger thing, but when we zoom out things become curved.</p>
