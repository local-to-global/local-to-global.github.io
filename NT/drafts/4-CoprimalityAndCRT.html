  Last time we saw how to figure out when there was an integer solution to equations like $ax+by=c$. In particular, there is a solution if and only if $c$ is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$. We'll introduce notation here to express this in a more flexible way. We let $\mathbb{Z}$ denote the set of all integers, and $n\mathbb{Z}$ the set of all multiples of $n$. So  an element of $n\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $na$ for some $a\in\mathbb{Z}$. Almost trivially, we have that $m|n$ if and only if $m\in n\mathbb{Z}$. We can rewrite Bezout's Identity along similar lines.
  </p>
  <p>
  If $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$, then we write $a\mathbb{Z}+b\mathbb{Z}$ for the set of all linear combinations of $\mathbb{Z}$. That is, an element of $a\mathbb{Z}+b\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $ax+by$ for some integer $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$. If $d=GCD(a,b)$, then Bezout's Identity can be written as:
  $$
  a\mathbb{Z} + b \mathbb{Z} = d\mathbb{Z}
  $$
  The interesting thing about this is it takes $a\mathbb{Z}+b\mathbb{Z}$, which has two components and can seem fairly complex, and turns it into the much simples $d\mathbb{Z}$. The fact that we can do this is nontrivial and depends on Euclidean division, as seen in the proofs on the previous post. Higher order number systems do not necessarily have Euclidean division, and we can't do this. In Ring Theory, we say that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a "Principle Ideal Domain". We can conceptualize $d$ as the "overlap" between $a$ and $b$, and the addition $a\mathbb{Z}+b\mathbb{Z}$ as the process of overlapping them (not intersecting).
  </p>
  <p>
  Our focus in this section will be ono the case when $GCD(a,b)=1$. This is when we can reconstruct all of $\mathbb{Z}$ from $a\mathbb{Z}+b\mathbb{Z}$, when every integer is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. This will be when $a$ and $b$ don't multiplicatively overlap at all. To this end, we say that $a$ and $b$ are <b>Coprime</b> if $GCD(a,b)=1$. This happens when $ a\mathbb{Z} + b\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}$. We have the following fundamental results about coprimality:
    </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proposition: </b> 
      <ol>
        <li>If $d=GCD(a,b)$, then $a/d$ and $b/c$ are coprime.
        <li>Let $a$ and $b$ be coprime. If $a|bc$ then $a|c$.</li> 
        <li> Conversely, if $a$ and $b$ are not coprime, then there is some $c$ so that $a\nmid c$ and $a|bc$. </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <ol>
        <li>Write $ax+by=d$. Dividing this through by $d$ gives $\left(\frac{a}{d}\right)x+\left(\frac{b}{d}\right)y=1$, which is equivalent to $a/d$ and $b/d$ being coprime.</li>
        <li>If $a|bc$, then we have an integer $n$ so that $an=bc$. Since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, write $ax+by=1$ or some integers $x,y$. Then we have that 
        $$
        any=ybc=c-axc
        $$
        which can be rearranged to $a(ny+xc)=c$. This means that $a|c$.
      </li>
      <li>
        If $d=GCD(a,b)$ and $d>1$, then we can find a number $e$ so that $a|e$ and $b|e$ and $e &lt ab$. Take $e=(a/d)b=a(b/d)$. So $a|bc$ where $c=a/d$. Since $c|a$, the only way we that $a|c$ is if $a=c$, which is not the case since $d>1$.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
      This result demonstrates how coprimality can be used to say something about divisibility, and vice versa. This proposition will also be key to understanding the multiplicative structure that we'll encounter in Modular Arithmetic. The next result is central to much of Number Theory, even if it seems a little innocuous at the moment. We usually wait until we get to Modular Arithmetic to state it, but it can be seen as a statement of linear Diophantine equations in a fairly elementary setting:
    </p>
    <div class="thm"><b> The Chinese Remainder Theorem: </b> Let $a$ and $b$ be coprime and $A,B$ any fixed integers. There exist a solution $x,y,z$ to the following system of equations:
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      x + ay &=& A\\
      x + bz &=& B
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      More generally, if $d=GCD(a,b)$ and $d|(A-B)$ then there is a solution to the above system of equations.
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <p>
        Clearly the coprime statement follows from the more general one. We can use the elementary method of "Elimination" to  eliminate the $x$, resulting in the single equation
        $$
        ay-bz=A-B
        $$
        Since $d|(A-B)$, this equation has a solution.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p> The importance of this is finding a single number $x$ that has a given remainder after dividing by $a$ and another given remainder after dividing by $b$. When $a$ and $b$, you can do this regardless of the remainders you have chosen. This, in effect, allows us to break apart difficult problems into many easier problems on coprime parts.
