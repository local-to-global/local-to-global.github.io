    We now know how to, in theory, figure out whether an equation like $ax+by=c$ has a solution. But there are still some computational holes in this. The equation has a solution if and only if $GCD(a,b)$ divides $c$, so how do we find $GCD(a,b)$? Furthermore, once we have determined that a solution exists, how do we find it? Figuring this out will give us an opportunity to get more familiar with these objects. Firstly, need to know a few arithmetic results about the GCD. 
    </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proposition: </b>
      Let $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}$ be nonzero integers.
      <ol>
        <li> If there is an integer $q$ so that $a=bq+c$, then $GCD(a,b)=GCD(b,c)$.</li>
        <li> We have $GCD(a,ba)=a$, $GCD(a,1)=1$ and $GCD(a,0)=a$.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <ol>
        <li>Note that $a$ is a linear combination of $b$ and $c$, so every common divisor of $b$ and $c$ divides $a$. This means that every common divisor of $b$ and $c$ is also a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. On the other hand, we can write $c=a-bq$, so $c$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. A similar argument shows that every common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is also a common divisor of $b$ and $c$. So these two sets of common divisors are the same, so they must have the same GCD.</li>
        <li> We're just writing this for reference, proving it will be left to the reader</li>

      The great thing about this result is that it gives us an explicit list of certain greatest common divisors, notably $GCD(a,0)=a$. The other part of this result, along with Euclidean Division, gives us the means to take any pair $a,b$ and reduce it to the case $GCD(a,0)=1$. To compute the GCD, we'll then use Euclidean Division to lower the numbers involved, without chanigng the GCD, until the nice case with a zero. This is the Euclidean Algorithm:
  </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>The Euclidean Algorithm: </b> Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers. Create the sequence $r_n$ defined as follows: 
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      r_0&=& b\\ 
      r_1&=& a\\
      r_{n+1} &=& r_{n-1} - r_nq_n
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      where $r_{n+1}$ is obtained from Euclidean Division as the remainder of $r_{n-1}$ divided by $r_n$ so that $0\leq r_{n+1}&lt |r_n|$. Note that if $r_n=0$ then $r_{n+1}=0$ by default. Under these conditions, there is some $N>0$ so that if n\leq N$ then $r_n>0$ and if $n > N$ then $r_n=0$. Furthermore $r_N=GCD(a,b)$.  
    </div>
    <div class = "thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <p>
        The sequence $r_n$ is eventually always zero since if $r_n\ne 0$ then $0\leq r_{n+1} &lt r_n$, forcing it to eventually be zero. Furthermore, if $r_N$ is the last nonzero element, then we have, by the proposition and the fact that we can write $r_{n+1}=r_{n-1}-r_nq_n$ for $n &lt N$, that 
        $$
        \begin{eqnarray*}
         r_N &=& GCD(r_N,r_{N+1})\\
             &=& GCD(r_{N-1},r_N)\\
             &=& GCD(r_{N-2},r_{N-1})\\
             &\vdots& \\
             &=& GCD(r_0,r_1)\\
             &=& GCD(a,b).
        \end{eqnarray*}
        $$

    This result gives us a fairly efficient way to compute the GCD of two numbers through simple division with remainder. With this result it shouldn't be too hard to determine whether or not an equation like $ax+by=c$ has a solution or not, since we can now quickly compute the GCD of $a$ and $b$. As an example:
    <div class="thm"><b>Example: </b>

      The Euclidean Algorithm tells us how to figure out if $ax+by=c$ has a solution, but how do we find it? Luckily, we have everything we need and just need to piece together a solution by working the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse. This will hinge on the proposition:
    </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proposition: </b> Let $a,b,c$ be integers and let $q,r$ be integers so that $b=aq+r$.  If $x=t$ and $y=s$ are integer solutions to $rx+ay=c$, then $x=s-qt$ and $y=t$ is a solution to $ax+by=c$.
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <p>
        This follows by replacing $r$ in $rx+ay=c$ with $r=b-aq$:
        $$
        \begin{eqnarray*}
        c &=& rt+as \\
          &=& (b-aq)t + as\\
          &=& a(s-qt) + bt
        \end{eqnarray*}
        $$
    </div>
    <p>
      From the Euclidean Algorithm, we already have $1\cdot r_N + 0 r_{N+1} = GCD(a,b)$, and so we will use the expression $r_{n-1}=r_nq_n+r_{n+1}$ to lift this solution up to one for $ax+by=GCD(a,b)$. This is the Extended Euclidean Algorithm: 
    <div class="thm"><b>The Extended Euclidean Algorithm: </b> Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers, and let $r_n$ and $N$ be as in the statement of the original Euclidean Algorithm. Further, let $q_n$ be the quotient so that $r_{n+1}=r_{n-1}-r_nq_n$. Define the sequences:
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      s_0 = 1 && t_0 = 0\\
      s_1 = 0 && t_1 = 1\\
      s_{n+1} = s_{n-1} - q_ns_n && t_{n+1} = t_{n-1} - q_nt_n
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
    Then for $0\leq k \leq N$ we have that $x=t_{N-k}$ and $y=s_{N-k}$ is a solution to $r_{k+1}x+r_{k}y=GCD(a,b)$. That is, 
      $$
      r_{k+1}t_{N-k}+r_ks_{N-k}=GCD(a,b)
      $$
      In particular, we have
      $$
      as_N + bt_N=GCD(a,b)
      $$
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <p>
        Since $r_N=GCD(a,b)$ and $r_{N+1}=0$, then we have $r_{N+1}t_0+r_Ns_0=GCD(a,b)$ and $r_Nt_1 + r_{N-1}s_1=GCD(a,b)$. So the result is valid for the first two base cases. Let $0\leq k \leq N-2$ and assume that $x=t_{N-k-1}$ and $y=S_{N-k-1}$ is a solution to $r_{k+2}x+r_{k+1}y=GCD(a,b)$. Since we have $r_{k-1} = r_nq_n+r_{k+1}$, the proposition says that $x=
       We then have
        $$
        \begin{eqnarray*}
        GCD(a,b) &=& r_{k+1}t_{N-k}+r_ks_{N-k}\\
                 &=& 
        \end{eqnarray*}
        $$
