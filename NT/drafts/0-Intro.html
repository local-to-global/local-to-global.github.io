  Number Theory has a very unique place in math. It is one of the oldest fields in mathematics and, unlike it's ancient contemporaries like Euclidean Geometry, it has continued to stump us. Despite active research almost anywhere and anytime that math has been done, it is still a complete and utter mystery to even the most knowledgable mathematicians. Anytime you think you're getting close to answering a fundamental question about the field, a new, harder question will pop out of the supposed solution. It may be the Queen of Mathematics, but this queen is a Hydra.

  Unlike other courses in a standard math degree, when you study Number Theory you do not need to become an expert with the "Number Theory Toolbox", because it doesn't really have a proper "toolbox". The proofs and results in Real Analysis will be needed later, no matter what field you eventually go into, so you need to really focus on knowing the tools. But you don't really need to be an expert in the proof methods in Number Theory unless you actually go into Number Theory. Part of this is because many of the more elementary results are simple corollaries of the Abstract Algebra toolbox. Therefore, the focus of an introductory Number Theory course does not need to be the technical aspects of the proofs and the tools being learned. Number Theory is huge and mysterious, due to its longevity, so the focus of an introductory Number Theory course should be in familiarizing the students with all the different heads to this hydra and how they relate. You do not need to leave being able to say "I know how to prove Quadratic Reciprocity", you need to leave being able to say "I know the question that Quadratic Reciprocity is trying to answer and the questions that can be asked from its solution". The goal is an intuitive understanding of the monster that is Number Theory, not a technical manual. When done with the course, you should be educated enough in the field to be able to say "I'm curious and want to focus on learning more Number Theory" or "What's Knot Theory all about?!"

  This is one of the main reaons why undergrad courses fail so much in connecting to the students. There are two general approaches. One is to treat it like an "Intro-to-Proofs" class. This is headache-producing because there is little to motivate the results other than being for your proof-mill, and it is redundant because this is the role of other classes. If you leave the course with nothing more than the knowledge that "Proof by Induction" is sounds familiar, then it is done wrong. This is attempted to be fixed through the second result, and that is to find a totally contrived example for every little result. If you are trying to motivate Wilson's Theorem through an application that doesn't take too much time to introduce, then you can bet it's going to be contrived, not really connect to the students, not really be important to that application and, worst of all, miss the point of Wilson's Theorem. Number Theory isn't an application field. Yes, you can do things like primality tests, factorization algorithms and cryptography, but there isn't really that much Number Theory in these. If you spend time talking about these things, then you have a Computer Science or Cryptography course, not a Number Theory course. Let the Computer Science departement worry about these, otherwise it will be half-assed and end up not covering enough Number Theory to make Number Theory seem fun and not covering enough CS or Cryptography to make them seem fun. What we end up with is a course structured like a Calculus course, but with Number Theory.

  I intend to go with a different approach. A course designed to be an overview of Number Theory. Rather than focusing on teaching how to do proofs or obtaining a toolbox, the focus is on sampling the different flavors of Number Theory. Proofs will, of course, be central to everything, so this should be seen as being at the advanced undergraduate level, rather than mid-undergraduate level. But you can at least follow along if you have just some experience with proofs.

  Number Theory is the oldest field in math. The greatest mathematicians of all time have dedicated their careers to it, so it is probably intrinsically interesting and we owe it to up-and-coming mathematicians to provide them with an idea of what this monster, that is so fundamental to math, is all about.
