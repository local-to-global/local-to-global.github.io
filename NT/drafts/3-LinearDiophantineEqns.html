  Last post, we looked at single variable Diophantine equations and used them to define and explore the arithmetic of division, coming up with divisibility, fraction arithmetic and division-with-remainder from those simple equations. Now we look at higher variable equations. A general linear Diophantine equation is an equation of the form
  $$
  a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n = b
  $$
  where $a_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and we seek solutions with $x_i\in\mathbb{Z}$. We wish to, first and foremost, figure out when these equations actually have solutions and this will be determined by figuring out the numbers $b$ that take the form $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n $ for some fixed $a_i$. We'll uncover many fundamental results in Number Theory from studying this equation.

  <h3>Linear Combinations and Common Divisors</h3>
  <p>
  Given integers $a_1,...,a_n$, assumed nonzero for simplicity, we wish to find the $b$ so that there is an integer solution to $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n =b$. There are then two types of numbers to consider when investigating this. The first is the set of <b>Linear Combinations</b> of the $a_i$. These are the numbers of the form $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n$ for some integers $x_i$, or, said another way, it is the numbers $b$ so that $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n=b$ has a solution. All we're doing is giving a name to the numbers we want to find. Note that in the $n=1$ case, the linear combinations of $a_1$ are just the multiples of $a_1$, that is, the $b$ so that $a_i|b$, so the notion of a Linear Combination generalizes the previous notion of divisibility.
  </p>
  <p>
  On the other hand, note that if $c$ is an integer so that for each $i$ we have $c|a_i$, then for any linear combination $b$ we automatically get $c|b$. We then say that if $c|a_i$ for $i=1,...,n$, then $c$ is a <b>Common Divisor</b> of $a_1,...,a_n$. We immediately get the result:
  </p>
  <div class="thm"><b>Proposition:</b> Let $a_1,...,a_n$ be nonzero integers and $b$ any linear combination of these $a_i$ and $c$ any common divisor. Then $c|b$.
  </div>
  <p>
  We then see that $b$ is a multiple of every common divisor of the $a_i$. A natural question to ask is if there is a discrepancy between the common divisors and linear combinations. That is, is ever number that is a multiple of each common divisor also a linear combination?
  </p>
  <p> 
  Towards this end, we would like to classify all linear combinations and all common divisors. Since the common divisors must divide each of the $a_i$, it follows that the biggest they can get is the size of the smallest of the $a_i$. Therefore, there is then a unique largest common divisor. The <b>Greatest Common Divisor</b> of the integers $a_1,...,a_n$ is the unique largest common divisor of these $a_i$. We denote this by $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$. On the other hand, since every linear combination is a multiple of each common divisor, it follows that each nonzero linear combination must be larger than or equal to, in absolute value,  $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$. So there is a unique smallest positive linear combination. Let the <b>Principle Combination</b> of the integers $a_1,...,a_n$ be the unique smallest positive linear combination of the $a_i$. We denote this by $PC(a_1,...,a_n)$. We then have $GCD(a_1,...,a_n) | PC(a_1,...,a_n)$. The question is then, how far apart are $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$ and  $PC(a_1,...,a_n)$? This, and more, are answered by the following:
  </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>Theorem: </b> Let $a_1,...,a_n$ be nonzero integers. Then
    $$
    GCD(a_1,...,a_n) = PC(a_1,...,a_n)
    $$
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <p>
        Since we know that $GCD(a_1,...,a_n) | PC(a_1,...,a_n)$, this implies that $GCD(a_1,...,a_n) \leq PC(a_1,...,a_n)$, so all we need to do is show that $PC(a_1,...,a_n)\leq GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$. We will do this by showing that $PC(a_1,...,a_n)$ is a common divisor of the $a_1,...,a_n$.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each $a_i$, we can then perform Euclidean Division with $PC(a_1,...,a_n)$. So let $q_i,r_i$ be integers, with $0\leq r_i &lt PC(a_1,...,a_n)$, so that $a_i = q_iPC(a_1,...,a_n)+r_i$. Now, $PC(a_1,...,a_n)$ is a linear combination of the $a_i$, in fact it is the smallest positive linear combination, so there are integers $x_1,...,x_n$ so that $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_nx_n=PC(a_1,...,a_n)$. From Euclidean Division, we can then write
        $$
        r_i = a_i - q_i (a_1x_1+\cdots+a_nx_n)
        $$
        The right side can be written as a linear combination of the $a_i$. Set $y_j=-q_ix_j$ for $i\ne j$ and $y_i=1-q_ix_i$, then we get
        $$
        r_i = y_1a_1+\cdots + y_na_n
        $$
        So $r_i$ is a linear combination of $a_1,...,a_n$. But $r_i$ is strictly less than $PC(a_1,...,a_n)$, since this is the smallest positive linear combination. Our only conclusion is then that $r_i$ is not positive and the only way for this to happen is $r_i=0$. This means that $a_i=q_iPC(a_1,...,a_n)$, which means that for all $i$ we have $PC(a_1,...,a_n)|a_i$, which means it is a common divisor of the $a_i$, which means that we must have $PC(a_1,...,a_n)\leq GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then conclude that $GCD(a_1,...,a_n) = PC(a_1,...,a_n)$.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
    From now on, in light of this theorem, we will only reference $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$ rather than $PC(a_1,...,a_n)$. This result allows us to completely classify all common divisors and linear multiples. In particular, we have
    <div class="thm"><b>Corollary: </b> Let $a_1,...,a_n$ be nonzero integers. The number $b\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a linear combination of the $a_i$ if and only if $b$ is a multiple of $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$. Additionally, $c\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a common divisor of the $a_i$ if and only if $c|GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$. 
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <p> We already know that if $b$ is a linear combination of the $a_i$, then we must have $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)|b$, so we need to prove the other direction. Assume that $b$ is a number so that $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)|b$. This means that $b=c\cdot GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$. But, from the theorem, $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$ is a linear combination of the $a_i$. We can then write $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)=a_1x_1+\cdots+a_nx_n$ for some integers $x_i$. This means that if we set $y_i=cy_i$ then we can write 
        $$
        b = a_1y_1+\cdots +a_ny_n
        $$
        And so $b$ is a linear combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear from the fact that $a|b$ and $b|c$ implies $a|c$, that if $d|GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$, then $d|a_i$ for each $i$ and so is a common divisor. For the other direction, let $d$ be an arbitrary common divisor of the $a_i$. We already know that every common divisor divides every linear combination, and by the theorem $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$ is a linear combination, so $d|GCD(a_1,...,a_n)$.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      What this result says is that the solutions to $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_nx_1=b$ are totally characterized by a single number: $GCD(a_1,..,a_n)$. A necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a solution is simply $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)|b$. This, essentially, takes the $n$-variable equation $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_nx_1=b$ and reduces it to the $1$-variable equation $GCD(a_1,...,a_n)\cdot x - b=0$. The former has a solution if and only if the latter does.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also feel that the fact that every common divisor divides the greatest common divisor is often taken for granted. At the start, we only know that every common divisor is less than or equal to the GCD, it requires a nontrivial theorem, such as this or the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, to prove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classical statement of this result is known as Bezout's Identity and specializes it to the two-variable case (you can do induction from there to get the general case). It is also the most used case of the theorem, so we'll state it for completeness and reference:
    </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>Bezout's Identity: </b> 
      <p>
        Let $a,b$ be integers with greatest common divisor $d$. There exists a solution to 
        $$
        ax+by=c
        $$
        If and only if $d|c$.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
    We now know how to figure out whether an equation like $ax+by=c$ has a solution. But how do we find a solution? For this we'll need to know a few arithmetic results about the GCD. 
    </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proposition: </b>
      
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      
    </div>
    <p>
      Armed with these results, we can devise a method to easily compute the GCD of a pair of numbers, and then find a solution to the associated Bezout Identity.
