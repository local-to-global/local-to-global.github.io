  <p>Pi can seem to pop up in a whole bunch of seemingly unrelated places. Least of which is as the solution to the Basel Problem:
  $$
  \frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2}+\frac{1}{5^2}+\cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
  $$
  Focusing less on the proof of this fact, we'll try to find a reason why we should expect pi to show up in this formula and others like it. The succinct reason why you should be able to expect it is that $\sin(\pi x)$ is, essentially, the only function whose set of zeros is exactly the integers. More precisely, $\sin(pi x)/x$ is, essentially, the only function whose set of zeros is exactly the non-zero integers. The reason for all this will give us a chance to explore a few different and interesting topics.

  <h3>Integers and Zeros of Functions</h3>
  <p>
  If you recall from high school or college level algebra class, if you have a polynomial then it is determined, up to a scaling factor, by its zeros (including repetition). For example, the only polynomials whose zeros are exactly $x=-1,1$ are the ones of the form
  $$
  c(x+1)(x-1) = cx^2-c
  $$
  for some nonzero scale $c$. Given a set of zeros, then, it is easy to find the unique polynomial (up to scale) that has these zeros. If the zeros are $x=a_1,...,a_n$, then you can just make the polynomial 
  $$
  (x-a_1)(x-a_2)\cdots (x-a_n)
  $$
  Expanding this might be difficult, but we still have made the polynomial we were looking for. This is a really nice property that polynomials have, and it isn't necesarily true for non-polynomial functions on the real line. However, if we look beyond to complex numbers, things become nicer. Differentiable functions of a complex variable are much nicer than their real counterparts, as the notion of differentiability is much more rigid and doesn't allow for as many pathalogical cases. In particular, differentiable functions on the whole complex plane behave a lot like polynomials. In particular, up to a "scale", a differentiable function on the complex plane is completely determined by its zeros. If we want a function with zeros $z=a_1,a_2,...$, then we can try ot make the function
  $$
  f(z) = (z-a_1)(z-a_2)(z-a_3)\cdots
  $$
  The only issue is that the for such functions, the zeros $a_i$ need to be able to grow, and so when you try to expand this out, you get infinitely large coefficients, which is not nice. So we, instead, create the function
  $$
  f(z) = \left(1-\frac{z}{a_1}\right)\left(1-\frac{z}{a_2}\right)\left(1-\frac{z}{a_3}\right)\cdots
  $$
  This is what we would get if we pulled out a $-a_i$ from the $i$th term, and ignored the resulting scale out front, so its the same idea as what happened with polynomials above just in a more infinity-friendly way. (Also, if any of the $a_i=0$, then we just put a $z$ outfront instead of pulling the zero out.) The great thing about complex numbers is that this function is, up to a scale, the only function with exactly these zeros. In this case "scale" is a little more sophisticated than in the polynomial case, and includes exponential functions and we have to deal with the infinitely many terms better, and it controls the growth rate of the function, but the idea is the same. This result is known as the Weierstrass Factorization of a function, and is key to a lot of the interactions between complex analysis and number theory.
  </p>
  <p>
  Speaking of numbers, we can now create a complex valued function that encodes within it the integers as its zeros:
  $$
  I(z) = z\left(1-\frac{z}{1}\right)\left(1+\frac{z}{1}\right)\left(1-\frac{z}{2}\right)\left(1+\frac{z}{2}\right)\left(1-\frac{z}{3}\right)\left(1+\frac{z}{3}\right)\cdots
  $$
  This is, up to exponential scale, the only function whose zeros are the integers, and $I(z)/z$ is the only function whose zeros are the non-zero integers. This is how Complex Analysis sees the integers as living inside the complex plane. In fact, through rotations and scales, this is how Complex Analysis sees any regularly spaced line of zeros in the complex plane. We are going to use this to find way to find a value for the sum $1+1/4+1/9+1/16+...$.
  </p>
  <p>
  We start by combining terms that have the same zero up to sign, like $(1-z/2)(1+z/2)=1-z^2/4$. This gives:
  $$
  I(z) = z\left(1-\frac{z^2}{1}\right)\left(1-\frac{z^2}{4}\right)\left(1-\frac{z^2}{9}\right)\left(1-\frac{z^2}{16}\right)\left(1-\frac{z^2}{25}\right)\cdots
  $$
  We can next turn this into a Taylor series for $I(z)$ by expanding this out to "standard form". The first, constant term will be zero since it is all multiplied by $z$ and the term in front of $z$ will be the product of all the 1s from each element of the product. There is no way to get a $z^2$ from this expansion, so the second term is zero. To get the $z^3$ coefficient, we can find all the ways to take just one non-1 term through the distribution. This ends up with the sum $1+1/4+1/9+1/16+...$ as the coefficient to $z^3$ in the Taylor expansion. These are the only terms we really care about, and we find that the Taylor expansion looks like:
  $$
  I(z) = z + \left(1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{4^2}+\cdots\right)z^3 + (\textrm{Higher order terms})
  $$
  This means that the sum we're interested in is the third coefficeint in the Taylor expansion of the unique function (up to scale) whose zeros are the integers. 
  </p>
  <h3>Circles</h3>
  <p>
    Circles and integers share a few important properties. Most notably is their regularness, or their periodicness. If we go around a circle, that is embedded into the cartesian plane, at a constant rate of rotation and keep track of the y-coordinate, then we'll find that we repeat ourself at regular intervals. If $\sin(t)$ is the y-coordinate at angle $t$, then we repeat ourself when we change $t$ by a multiple of $2\pi$. More importantly, we get the same thing, up to a sign, whenever we change $t$ by a multiple of $\pi$. In a way, $\pi$ is can be defined as "The number so that $\sin(t+\pi)=-\sin(t)$", so $\pi$ is intrinsically linked to this repetition. Whatever number does this, that's what $\pi$ is. The way radians related angles and arclength then implies that the circumference of a circle  of radius $r$ is $2\pi r$. When you think of $\pi$, you can then think of it as the "Regularity Constant". 
    </p>
    <p>
      From the periodicity of the circle, we find that $\sin(\pi t)=0$ exactly when $t$ is an integer. This means that $\sin(\pi t)$ is  function whose zeros are exactly the integers. Moreover, the sine function is nice enough so that it equals its Taylor series, which means that it can be expanded to the whole complex plane, and that we have the equation
      $$
      \sin(\pi z) = \pi z-\frac{\pi^3z^3}{6}+(\textrm{Higher Order Terms})
      $$
What we then have is another function on the whole complex plane whose zeros are exactly the integers. We then have two such functions, one created by just working with the zeros as if they were integers (a regularly spaced distribution of zeros on a line), and the other was obtained by examining the regularity of the circle. The theorems of Complex Analysis then tell us that $\sin(\pi z)$ and $I(z)$ can only differ from each other by a "scale". In general, this scale can be a pretty complicated function, but the you only get complicated scales when you the functions grow at different rates. The limited growth on $\sin(\pi z)$ shows that the $\sin(\pi z)$ and $I(z)$ can only differ by the scale of a constant. We can figure this constant out by examining $\sin(\pi z)/z$ and $I(z)/z$ at zero. The value of $\sin(\pi z)/z$ at $z=0$ is $\pi$ and the value of $I(z)/z$ at $z=0$ is $1$, which you can figure out from the Taylor expansions. This means that 
      $$
      \frac{1}{\pi}\sin(\pi z) = I(z)
      $$
      Comparing Taylor series givese
      $$
      z - \frac{\pi^2}{6}z^3 + (\textrm{Higher Order Terms}) = z - \left(1+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots\right) z^3 +(\textrm{Higher Order Terms})
      $$
      From this, we conclude that 
      $$
      1+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
      $$
      Through this interpretation of this proof, the $\pi$ appears in this because of the periodic distribution of the integers in the real line. We took advantage of the integers being the zeros of a function to extract the sum of reciprocal squares, and the fact that these zeros were periodically distributed means that we encounter a $\pi$.
    <h3>The Gamma Function</h3>
    <p>
      We can understand some of the behavior of the Gamma Function with some of this in mind. Heuristically, the Gamma funcion extends the factorial, and the factorial has the behavior $(n-1)!=n!/n$. Plugging in $n=0$ for this shows that we should expect $(-1)!=0!/0 = \infty$, and similarly, $(-n)!=\infty$. As the Gamma function satisfies $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!$, we find that $\Gamma(N)=\infty$ for $N=0,-1,-2,-3,-4...$. As the Gamma Function doesn't have any zeros, we can consider the function $\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}$ which has zeros exactly at $z=0,-1,-2,-3,-4,...$, the non-positive integers. The similarity to sine should be somewhat apparent. What we essentially have, just based on the zeros, is "half" of $\sin(\pi z)$. We can then use the Gamma function to reconstruct sine, as $1/\Gamma(1-z)$ has zeros exactly at $z=1,2,3,4,...$, this gives:
      $$
      \frac{\pi}{\Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z)} = \sin(\pi z)
      $$
      Where the $\pi$ in the numerator is the scaling constant. This demonstrates the arithmetic significance of the Gamma function, as its poles are related to the integers, as well as the appearance of $\pi$ in a lot of formulas involving factorials and the Gamma function such as $(1/2)!=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$.
