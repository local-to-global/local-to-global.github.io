    The equation for a line that passes through the point $(a,b)$ with slope $m$ is $y=m(x-a)+b$. This is a simple equation, but why does it give a line when graphed?

      To answer this question we need to know a little about Similar Triangles. Two triangles are similar if their angles are all the same. If two triangles are similar, then you can scale one onto the other. This means if the lengths on one of the triangles are $A,B,C$, then there is some scale $s$ so that the lengths on the other triangle are $sA,sB,sC$. This can help show that similar trianlges' sides share the same ratio. Indeed, ratio between the $A$ and $B$ sides of the first is $A/B$, and the ratio of the $A$ and $B$ sides in the second are $sA/sB = A/B$. Scaling doesn't affect this ratio. If we make a right triangle, then, we find that the ratio of the vertical and horizontal legs does not change under scale.
