      Wiles gave the first successful proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But what he actually proved seems to have little to do with Fermat's equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$. Instead, Wiles proved a technical result about how to parameterize and associate modular forms with elliptic curves, explicitly known as the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. In general, Fermat's Last Theorem follows from a few different very deep and difficult results like the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. In this article, we'll look at three different cases like this and prove Fermat's Last Theorem assuming that the hard part is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we'll go at it from the left-field and prove it via the ABC-Conjecture which, at this point, may or may not be a theorem of Mochizuki. The proof via the ABC-Conjecture is fairly simple, as the ABC Conjecture reduces it to finitely many cases that can be easily checked. Next we will prove it only assuming Serre's Modularity Conjectures, now known as the Khare-Witenberger Theorem. This is related to Wiles' approach, but distinct. Next we'll investigate Wiles' approach, assuming the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, along with Ribet's Theorem which was known as Serre's Epsilong Conjecture, since it is a very weak form of Serre's Modularity Conjecture, that gives just enough to allow us to prove Fermat's Last Theorem via Wiles' approach.

    <h3>Via the ABC Conjecture</h3>
    <p>
      The ABC-Conjecture is a very deep conjecture that, on the surface, gives us information about what happens to prime factorizations through addition. If you know the prime factorization of two numbers, then it is really simple to find the prime factorization of their product. From this, if we generally attack solving equations by figuring out how to turn them into products somehow. For instance, we can take the expression $x^2+y^2$ and factor it as $x^2+y^2=(x+iy)(x-iy)$. Finding integer solutions to this then reduces too discussing multiplicative properties of the Gaussian Integers. Equations that can't be reduced through some multiplicative factorization process are much harder to work with. One such equation is Fermat's Equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$. But the ABC-Conjecture can give us multiplicative information through addition, by relating the primes of numbers to the primes of their sums.

    <h4>The "Theorem"</h4>
    <p>If $x$ is an integer, we let $rad(x)$ denote it's "radical", which is the product of all primes dividing it, essentially getting rid of all higher exponents. So $rad(12)=6$ since $12=2^2\cdot 3$, and getting rid of the higher exponents gives $2\cdot 3=6$. How $x$ compares to $rad(x)$ tells us something about how big the exponents appearing in the prime factorization of $x$ are. The ABC-Conjecture then says that for every $\epsilon >0$ there is a constant $K_{\epsilon}$ so that for any coprime integers $A,B,C$ with $A+B=C$, we have
      $$
      C &lt K_{\epsilon}\cdot rad(ABC)^{1+\epsilon}
      $$
      This puts a bound on the ratio $C/rad(C)$, as we can rewrite this inequality as
      $$
      \frac{C}{rac(C)} %lt K_{\epsilon} rad(AB)^{1+\epsilon} \cdot rad(C)^{\epsilon}
      $$
      If the primes of $A$ and $B$ have large exponents, then $rad(A) \ll A$ and $rad(B)\ll B$, and so the right side of this can be thought of as relatively small, which means that $C/rad(C)$ should be relatively small, which means that $C$ can't have prime powers that are too big. This is one of the main results that Mochizuki has allegedly proved in his mysterious papers back in 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, a stronger version of the ABC-Conjecture. This is not addressed by Mochizuki. The strong version says that not only does the constant $K_{\epsilon}$ exist, but, in particular, we can take $K_1=1$. This is consistent with computations, but we do not even have an alleged proof of this version. 
    </p>
    <h4>Proving Fermat's Last Theorem</h4>
    <p>Consider a possible solution to Fermat's Equation, $a^n+b^n=c^n$, with $a,b,c$ coprime. We can apply the ABC-Conjecture to this by setting $A=a^n$, $B=b^n$ and $C=c^n$. The ABC-Conjecture then says that
      $$
      c^n &lt K_{\epsilon} rad(a^nb^nc^n)^{1+\epsilon}
      $$
      Raising a number to a power does not change its radical, so we get $c^n &lt K_{\epsilon} rad(abc)^{1+\epsilon}$. Furthermore, $rad(a),rad(b),rad(c) \leq c$, since $a,b,c\leq c$, and we can split the radical through multiplication since $a,b,c$ are coprime. This means that we can reduce the above formula to
      $$
      c^n  &lt K_{\epsilon}c^{3+3\epsilon}
      $$
      If we put $\epsilon=1/6$, then this says that $c^{n-7/2} &lt K_{1/6}$. So if $n>3$, we have $n-7/2 > n/8$, and we get 
      $$
      c^n &lt K_{1/6}^8
      $$
      Therefore, for any fixed exponent, there can only be finitely many counterexamples. Furthermore, since for high enough exponents we have $c^n > 2^n > K_{1/6}^8$, it follows that there are no counterexamples for large enough exponent. What we have then proved is that there are only finitely many counterexamples to Fermat's Last Theorem and, in particular, there is some integer $n_0$ so that Fermat's Last Theorem holds for all exponents larger than $n_0$. This is the Asymptotic Fermat's Last Theorem and it says that Fermat's Last Theorem is eventually true. This is what the ABC-Conjecture and Mochizuki's "proof" can show. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In principle, then, if we can compute any one of these $K_{\epsilon}$, and it is small enough, we could then fill in the gaps by proving Fermat's Last Theorem for each exponent up to the one it bounds. This is where the Strong ABC-Conjecture comes in. This says that $K_1=1$. Plugging this in gives us $c^n &lt c^6$, which automatically means that Fermat's Last Theorem is true for all $n\geq 6$. Since we have proofs for the exponents $n=3,4,5$, the full version of Fermat's Last Theorem follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the ABC-Conjecture implies the Asymptotic Fermat's Last Theorem, and the Strong ABC-Conjecture implies the full Fermat's Last Theorem.
    </p>
      
 
    <h3>Frey Curves</h3>
    <p>
      The remaining proofs rely on creating an elliptic curve from a possible counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem. These are known as Frey Curves. In general, if $A+B=C$, then we can create the elliptic curve $E$ given by the equation
      $$
      y^2 = x(x-A)(x+B)
      $$
      These curves satisfy some nice properties and we can explicitly compute a lot of invariants associated to it. One such invariant is the discriminant $\Delta_E$, which comes out to be
      $$
      \Delta_E = 
      $$
      The discriminant parameterizes the primes where the elliptic curve has "Bad Reduction". What this means is that if you look at the curve modulo one of these primes, then you don't end up with a nice looking elliptic curve. 
      and in the cases we'll need, the conductor of this elliptic curve can be computed to be $N_E=rad(ABC)$. This means that $E$ has bad reduction exactly at the primes dividing $abc$ and at $2$. It should be noted that there is a version of the ABC-Conjecture for elliptic curves, called the Szpiro Conjecture, that discusses the conductor. 
    </p>
    <p>
      From this curve $E$, we can create the Galois representation $\rho_{E,p}:G_{\mathbb{Q}}\rightarrow GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$, where $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$. This is constructed by noting that the $p$-torsion points on $E$ over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, denoted $E[p](\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$, is isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_p^2$. The $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$ action on $E[p](\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ can then be expressed as a matrix in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$. In one of his main papers discussing his conjecture, Serre proves that, in this case, $E$ is an irreducible representation and computes the conductor $N_{E,p}$ of this representation, along with other invariants. What he shows is that 2 divides the conductor and that odd primes $\ell$ divide the conductor if and only if the exponent of $\ell$ in $ABC$ is not a multiple of $p$.
    </p>
 
    <h3>Via Serre's Modularity Conjecture</h3>
    <p>
      Serre's Modularity Conjectures are based off of ideas coming from Class Field Theory, Modular Forms, Galois Representations, Elliptic Curves, and some sophisticated Algebraic Geometry. Class Field Theory showed that there is a correspondence between 1-dimensional representations of Galois groups and 1-dimensional representations of other arithmetic objects. Serre's Modularity Conjecture is an attempt to extend this, somehow, to talk about 2-dimensional representations of Galois groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serre's conjecture discusses two types of representations. Firstly, we have Galois representations over finite fields. In particular, we care about irreducible, odd (complex conjugation acts like -1) representations
      $$
      \rho: G_{\mathbb{Q}}\rightarrow GL_2(\mathbb{F})
      $$
      where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field of characteristic $p$, for some prime $p$. These naturally arise in many contexts, in particular from elliptic curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, we have representations associated to Modular Forms. In particular, we are concerned with modular forms $f(z)$ that are cusp eigenforms. This means that they have good behavior at cusps and are the eigenvectors for certain natural operators on the space of modular forms. Along with some other technical conditions, we say that a representation 
      $$
      \rho_f: G_{\mathbb{Q}}\rightarrow GL_2(\mathbb{F})
      $$
      is associated to a such modular form $f(z)$ if the trace of the Frobenius above $\ell$ is equal to $a_{\ell}$, the $\ell$th Fourier coefficient of $f(z)$, modulo an appropriate prime above $p$. The main spirit of the Serre conjectures is that every such Galois representation can be associated to some modular form in this way. Serre's do conjectures get more precise. Importantly, given a Galois representation $\rho$, the predict the conductor and level of the modular form that should be associated to it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To then prove Fermat's Last Theorem, we consider the representation $\rho_{E,p}$ described above associated to a possible counter example of Fermat's Last Theorem. In particular, if $a^p+b^p=c^p$, then we can take $A=a^p$, $B=b^p$ and $C=c^p$. From the above description, we know what the conductor of this representation looks like. Since $ABC$ is, itself, a $p$-power, it follows that every odd prime will have an exponent that is a multiple of $p$. So the only prime that divides the conductor is 2. By Serre's Conjectures, there is a modular form associated to this representation and, furthermore, from the description of the conductor and other invariants of this representation, it follows that this modular form must have conductor 2 and level 2. The issue is that no such modular form exists. Therefore, the existence of a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem provides a counterexample to Serre's Conjectures, which have been proved to be true. So Fermat's Last Theorem must true.
