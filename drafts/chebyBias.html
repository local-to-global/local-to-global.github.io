    Chebyshev's Bias says that, most of the time, for fixed $q$ there will be more primes less than $x$ congruent to a non-residue mod $q$ than congruent to a residue mod $q$. Of course this bias evens out as $x\rightarrow \infty$, but it is interesting to wonder why this bias exists for most finite $x$.

    <p>
    The answer to this is relatively easy to state. There is a bias towards non-residues among primes because prime-powers are, on average, equidistributed. That is, for most $x$, the number of prime-powers less than $x$ are generally equidistributed mod $q$. Now, most prime powers less than a number are primes, fewer are squares and even less are higher powers. Chebyshev's Bias then comes from primes and squares of primes trying to equidistribute themselves mod $q$. But all of the prime squares have to be congruent to a quadratic residue mod $q$, which means there is less room for primes to be congruent to these residues, hence we get a bias for primes to be non-residues.

    This is a good intuition and heristic to have, but it is fun to look at how this works more explicitly.

    <h3>The Prime-Power Residue Counting Function</h3>
    <p>
      What we want to do is, for every $k$, compare the number of $k$th residues of $a$ mod $q$ less than a number $x$ to the average number of $k$th residues that exist over all $b$ mod $q$ less than $x$, where $(a,q)=(b,q)=1$. If we have $\pi_k(x,a;q)$ be the number of $k$th residues of $a$ mod $q$ that are less than $x$, so the $n&lt x$ so that $n^k\equiv a\mod q$, then we will be concerned with the sign of 
      $$
      \pi_k(x,a;q) - \frac{1}{\varphi(q)}\sum_{(b,q)=1} \pi_k(x,b;q)
      $$
      Moreover, since we're interested in all powers simultaneously, we will want to combine this for all $k$. In particular, we will care about the sign of the value
        $$
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\log x}{n\sqrt{x}}\left( \varphi(q)\pi_k(x,a;q) - \sum_{(b,q)=1} \pi_k(x,b;q)\right) 
        $$
        Here the extra term out front is to weight things more evenly.
    If $\theta(x)=\sum_{p\leq x} \log p$ and $\psi(x) =\sum_{p^n\leq x}\log p$, then one of the more interesting formulas seen in any intro Analytic Number Theory course is
    $$
    \psi(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \theta(x^{1/k})
    $$
    This is at the heart of many early approximations to things like the Prime Number Theorem. But this gives information about all primes and prime powers, we want to get information about primes mod $q$. We then make the functions
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      \theta(x,a;q) &=& \sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\equiv a \mod q}} \log p\\
      \psi(x,a;q) &=& \sum_{\substack{p^n\leq x \\ p\equiv a \mod q}} \log p 
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
    We can't get an analogous formula as directly relating these two functions because there can be multiple residues for each $a\mod q$ that we have to account for. Towards this end, we can write
      $$
      \theta_k(x,a;q) = \sum_{\substack{b &lt q\\ b^k\equiv a \mod q}} \theta(x^{1/k},b;q)
      $$
      and this will be the appropriate analog for $\theta(x^{1/k})$ giving us the formula
      $$
      \psi(x,a;q) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \theta_k(x,a;q)
      $$
      What we want to do is use this to give an approximation for the number of primes, or prime powers, less than $x$ that are congruent to $a\mod q$. The connection to the counting functions is inspired by the connection to the prime counting function via the Riemann-Stieltjes Integral. We have $\pi(x) = \int_2^{x}\frac{d\theta(t)}{\log t}$. Following this reasoning, if $\pi_k(x,a;q)$ are the $k$th prime powers that are congruent to $a\mod q$ then we have
      $$
      \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}\pi_k(x,a;q) = \int_2^x \frac{d\psi(t,a;q)}{\log t}
      $$
      This is a weighted sum to weight each prime power residue equally when they exit.
