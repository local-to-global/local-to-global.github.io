    Chebyshev's Bias says that, most of the time, for fixed $q$ there will be more primes less than $x$ congruent to a non-residue mod $q$ than congruent to a residue mod $q$. Of course this bias evens out as $x\rightarrow \infty$, but it is interesting to wonder why this bias exists for most finite $x$. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The answer to this is relatively easy to state. There is a bias towards non-residues among primes because prime-powers are, on average, equidistributed. That is, for most $x$, the number of prime-powers less than $x$ are generally equidistributed mod $q$. Now, most prime powers less than a number are primes, fewer are squares and even less are higher powers. Chebyshev's Bias then comes from primes and squares of primes trying to equidistribute themselves mod $q$. But all of the prime squares have to be congruent to a quadratic residue mod $q$, which means there is less room for primes to be congruent to these residues, hence we get a bias for primes to be non-residues.

    This is a good intuition and heristic to have, but it is fun to look at how this works more explicitly.

    <h3>The Prime-Power Residue Counting Function</h3>
    <p>
      What we want to do is, for every $k$, compare the number of $k$th residues of $a$ mod $q$ less than a number $x$ to the average number of $k$th residues that exist over all $b$ mod $q$ less than $x$, where $(a,q)=(b,q)=1$. If we have $\pi_k(x,a;q)$ be the number of $k$th residues of $a$ mod $q$ that are less than $x$, so the $n&lt x$ so that $n^k\equiv a\mod q$, then we will be concerned with the sign of 
      $$
      \pi_k(x,a;q) - \frac{1}{\varphi(q)}\sum_{(b,q)=1} \pi_k(x,b;q)
      $$
      Moreover, since we're interested in all powers simultaneously, we will want to combine this for all $k$. In particular, we will care about the sign of the value
        $$
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k(x,a;q) 
        $$
      where
      $$
      E_k(x,a;q) = \frac{\log x}{k\sqrt{x}}\left( \varphi(q)\pi_k(x,a;q) - \sum_{(b,q)=1} \pi_k(x,b;q)\right)
      $$
        Here the extra term out front is to weight things more evenly. These expression come naturally when we combine and approximate a few key functions, which will provide us with a formula. These key expressions are 
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      \psi(x,a;q) &=& \frac{1}{\varphi(q)}\psi(x) + \sum_{\chi\ne \textrm{id}} \overline{\chi}(a) \psi(x,\chi)\\
      \int_2^{x} \frac{d\psi(t,a;q)}{\log t} &=& \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} \pi_k(x,a;q)
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      Combining these and applying some approximations, we then find that 
        $$
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k(x,a;q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\sum_{\chi\ne \textrm{id}} \overline{\chi}(a)\psi(x,\chi)
        $$
