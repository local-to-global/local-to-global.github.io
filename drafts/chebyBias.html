    Chebyshev's Bias says that, most of the time, for fixed $q$ there will be more primes less than $x$ congruent to a non-residue mod $q$ than congruent to a residue mod $q$. Of course this bias evens out as $x\rightarrow \infty$, but it is interesting to wonder why this bias exists for most finite $x$. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The answer to this is relatively easy to state. There is a bias towards non-residues among primes because prime-powers are, on average, equidistributed. That is, for most $x$, the number of prime-powers less than $x$ are generally equidistributed mod $q$. Now, most prime powers less than a number are primes, fewer are squares and even less are higher powers. Chebyshev's Bias then comes from primes and squares of primes trying to equidistribute themselves mod $q$. But all of the prime squares have to be congruent to a quadratic residue mod $q$, which means there is less room for primes to be congruent to these residues, hence we get a bias for primes to be non-residues.

    This is a good intuition and heristic to have, but it is fun to look at how this works more explicitly.

    <h3>The Prime-Power Residue Counting Function</h3>
    <p>
      What we want to do is, for every $k$, compare the number of $k$th residues of $a$ mod $q$ less than a number $x$ to the average number of $k$th residues that exist over all $b$ mod $q$ less than $x$, where $(a,q)=(b,q)=1$. Let $\pi_k(x,a;q)$ be the number of $k$th residues of $a$ mod $q$ that are less than $x$, so the $n&lt x$ so that $n^k\equiv a\mod q$. We can express this via the ordinary prime counting function as
      $$
      \pi_k(x,a;q) = \sum_{b^k\equiv a \mod q} \pi(x^{1/k},b;q)
      $$
      where $\pi(x,a;q)=\pi_1(x,a;q)$ and the sum is over all $k$th residues of $a$ less than $q$. Since $\pi(x^{1/k},b;q)$ can be approximated as $\frac{k}{\varphi(q)}\frac{x^{1/k}}{\log x}$, it follows that as we increase the power, then then this gets artificially inflated by the $k$. So when counting, we should weigh each count by $1/k$ to make different powers worth the same. We will then be considerd with the difference      
      $$
      E_k(x,a;q) = \frac{\log x}{k\sqrt{x}}\left( \varphi(q)\pi_k(x,a;q) - \sum_{(b,q)=1} \pi_k(x,b;q)\right)
      $$
      This measures how many more or less $k$th prime powers are less than $x$ and congruent to $a$ mod $q$ compared to the average number of $k$th powers congruent to coprime elements mod $q$. The factor out front is the most useful scale, where the $\sqrt{x}$ is useful because we are assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, and the $1/k$ is there as discussed above. We can get an asymptotic relationship for $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k(x,a;q)$ using standard techniques to get
        $$
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k(x,a;q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\sum_{\chi\ne \textrm{id}} \overline{\chi}(a)\psi(x,\chi) + O(1/\log x)
        $$
      Following the heuristic of <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1048515870">Rubenstein and Sarnack</a>, we see the term on the right as not having any significant bias towards any particular $a$. That is, the sign of this value will alternate at roughly the same rate, regardless of $a$. The bias then comes in when we try to approximate $E_k(x,a;q)$ for higher order $k$. We can approximate $E_k$ using Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions, as we alluded to above. Particularly, Dirichlet's theorem says that
      $$
      \pi_k(x,a;q) = \frac{kr_k(a;q)}{\phi(q)} \frac{x^{1/k}}{\log x} + O\left(\frac{x}{\log x})
      $$
   where $r_k(a;q)$ is the number of $k$th residues $a$ has mod $q$. This comes from the fact that there are $r_k(a;q)$ terms in the sum that can all be approximated in the same way. This gives us the approximation
      $$
      E_k(x,a;q) = \frac{\log x}{k\sqrt{x}}\left( \varphi(q)\frac{kr_k(a;q)}{\phi(q)} \frac{x^{1/k}}{\log x} - \sum_{(b,q)=1} \frac{kr_k(b;q)}{\phi(q)} \frac{x^{1/k}}{\log x}\right)
      $$
