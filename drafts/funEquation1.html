    <p>What are the integer solutions to the equation $x^y=y^x$? What about rational solutions? What about real solutions? Clearly we always have a solution when $x=y$, but what about when $x\ne y$? This is a fun little equation to solve and analyze. 
    </p>
    <h3>All real and integer solutions</h3>
    <p> Lets first classify all the real solutions, as this will help us find solutions in other number systems. Firstly, if we log both sides of the equation $a^b=b^a$ and rearrange things a bit, we get
    $$
    \frac{\log(a)}{a}=\frac{\log(b)}{b}
    $$
    So if we set $f(x)=\log(x)/x$, then we'll have a solution to $a^b=b^a$ exactly when we have $f(a)=f(b)$, and happens when a horizontal line intersects the graph of our function at $x=a$ and $x=b$, so we should understand a bit about this graph. Note that $f(x)$ is a continuous and differentiable function for all $x>0$. Its derivative is 
    $$
    f'(x)= \frac{1-\log(x)}{x^2}
    $$
    And since the denominator is always nonzero in this domain, we get one critical point at $x=e$. Moreover, since the denominator is always positive, and $\log(x) &lt; 1$ when $x &lt; e$ and $\log(x)>1$ when $x>e$, it follows that $x=e$ is a local maxima, and the funciton increases on the interval $(0,e)$ and decreases on the interval $(e,\infty)$. So, in fact, $x=e$ is the global maxima as well.  Moreover, the value of this maximum is $f(e)=1/e$. In fact, we have that $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+}f(x)=-\infty$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}=0$.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of this means is that on the interval $(0,e)$, the function $f(x)$ strictly increases across the entire range $(-\infty,1/e)$ and on the interval $(e,\infty)$, the it strictly decreases across the entire range $(0,1/e)$. It should also be noted that $f(1)=0$. We can see this as the red graph here:

    <p>
    Whenever we can we draw a horizontal line that intersects this graph at two differnt places, we get a nontrivial solution to this equation. The above shows that this can happen exactly for pairs $a$ and $b$ when one of them is in the interval $(1,e)$ and the other is in the interval $(e,\infty)$. So there are infinitely many solutions to this, one for each number in the interval $(1,e)$.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now we know that there are tons of solutions. Right away, we can show that $a=2$, $b=4$ is the only integer solution. This is because there is only one integer in the range $(1,e)$, and that integer is $2$, and since $2^4=4^2$, it follows that $a=2$ and $b=4$ is an integer solution and that there are no other possibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
     But given an $a$ in the interval $(1,e)$, what does the corresponding $b$ look like? If we have a solution $a^b=b^a$ and set $r=\log_a(b)$, then we have $b=a^r$. Can we turn this around? Can we express both $a$ and $b$ simply in terms of this exponent $r$? If we plug in $b=a^r$ into $\log(a)/a=\log(b)/b$, then we get
       $$
       \frac{\log(a)}{a}=\frac{r\log(a)}{a^r}
       $$
     which means that $r=a^{r-1}$, or $a=r^{1/(r-1)}$ and so $b=r^{r/(r-1)}$. This tells us how to recover $a$ and $b$ individually from a given $r$ so that $b=a^r$ is a solution to $a^b=b^a$. Of note is that any $a$ in the interval $(1,e)$ can be written as $a=r^{1/(r-1)}$ for some unique $r>1$. Moreover, given any $r>1$ we get that $r^{1/(r-1)}$ is in the interval $(1,e)$. This means that the real numbers $r>1$ uniquely parameterize the solutions to $a^b=b^a$ through
       $$
       \begin{eqnarray*}
       a & = & r^{1/(r-1)}\\
       b & = & r^{r/(r-1)}
       \end{eqnarray*}
       $$
    This completely characterizes all solutions to the equation $x^y=y^x$.
    </p>
    <h3>All rational solutions</h3>
    <p>
      But what about the rational solutions? When is both $a=r^{1/(r-1)}$ and $b=r^{r/(r-1)}$ rational numbers? Recall that we have $a=b^r$, so if $a$ and $b$ are both rational, then so is $r$. This is because one thing preventing these from being rational is the fraction in the exponent. If we impose that $\frac{1}{r-1}=n$ is an integer, then we find that $r=1+1/n$. In this canse $\frac{r}{1-r}=n+1$ is also an integer. So if $n$ is any positive integer and we set $r=1+1/n$ then we get the pair
       $$
       \begin{eqnarray*}
       a & = & \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}\\
       b & = & \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n+1}
       \end{eqnarray*}
       $$
      which satisfies $a^b=b^a$. These are the values you get when you put $r=1+\frac{1}{n}$. Note that when $n=1$ we get $a=2$ and $b=4$. These are also the value of $r$ required so that the exponents, $\frac{1}{r-1}$ and $\frac{r}{r-1}$, are simultaneously integers.
    </p>
    <p>The real question is then about whether or not these are all of the rational solutions. To figure this out, note that whenever $a=r^{1/(r-1)}$ and $b=r^{r/(r-1)}$ are solutions, then we have $a=rb$ (check this yourself!), so if $a$ and $b$ are rational, then so must $r=a/b$. In fact, any two of the numbers $a,b,r$ being rational implies that the third one is. This means that we just need to figure out when $a$ and $r$ are rational, as this will imply that $b$ is rational.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards this end, assume that $r=\frac{n}{m}$ is rational, with $m,n$ coprime integers and $n>m$. It then follows that $\frac{1}{r-1}=\frac{m}{n-m}$ is also rational and we can prove that $m$ and $n-m$ are coprime. So 
      $$a=r^{1/(r-1)}=(n/m)^{m/(n-m)}=\frac{x}{y}$$ 
      where $x,y$ are coprime integers. Rearranging the last equality shows that $n^my^{n-m}=m^mx^{n-m}$, and the comprimeness conditions on various pairs of these give us the two equations
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      n^m &=& x^{n-m}\\
      m^m &=& y^{n-m}
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      The key thing here is that the exponents $m$ and $n-m$ are coprime, and if $p$ is a prime, then $p$ must divide each side of each of these equations the same number of times. So if $p$ divides $n$ a $k$ number of times, then it divides $n^m$ a $mk$ number of times, and if it divides $x$ a $j$ number of times, then it divides $x^{n-m}$ a $(n-m)j$ number of times. Since, then, $mk=(n-m)j$, we find that $m$ divides $j$. This is true for any prime, which means that we can write $x$ as $u^m$ for some integer $m$. Similarly, we have $y=v^m$ for some integer $v$. All this means is that
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      n &=& u^{n-m}\\
      m &=& v^{n-m}
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      Note that $u>v$. Let's then write $n-m=k$ for some integer $k$. We then have 
      $$
      k=u^k-v^k \geq 2^k-1^k
      $$
      Since for $k>1$ we have $2^k-1>k$, it follows that we must have $k=1$. Therefore, we have $n=m+1$ and $r=1+1/m$, which are exactly the solutions from before.
