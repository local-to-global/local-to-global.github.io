  <p> There is not much appreciation for Ramanujan's derivation of the "fact" that $1+2+3+4+\cdots =-1/12$. One criticism is that his method does not generalize to a more formal way to make this identification (like the Zeta Function). Further, the formula for triangle numbers $1+2+3+\cdots +n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is often used as an excuse to outright dismiss any kind of discussion about this fake-fact. In this I will prove the formula for the triangular numbers using arguments similar to Ramanujan's and then use this to find a way to formally identify $1+2+3+\cdots$ with $-1/12$ that uses Ramanujan's arguments.

  <h3>Ramanujan's "Proof"</h3>
  Let's first review how Ramanujan got to the conclusion that $1+2+3+..."="-1/12$. Of course, this isn't true using any typical notion of a sum, but it is the most meaningful finite number to assign to this divergent series.
