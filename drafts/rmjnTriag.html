  <p> There is not much appreciation for Ramanujan's derivation of the "fact" that $1+2+3+4+\cdots =-1/12$. One criticism is that his method does not generalize to a more formal way to make this identification (like the Zeta Function). Further, the formula for triangle numbers $1+2+3+\cdots +n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is often used as an excuse to outright dismiss any kind of discussion about this fake-fact. In this I will prove the formula for the triangular numbers using arguments similar to Ramanujan's and then use this to find a way to formally identify $1+2+3+\cdots$ with $-1/12$ that uses Ramanujan's arguments.

  <h3>Ramanujan's "Proof"</h3>
  Let's first review how Ramanujan got to the conclusion that $1+2+3+..."="-1/12$. Of course, this isn't true using any typical notion of a sum, but it is the most meaningful finite number to assign to this divergent series.   
    
  <h3>Triangle Numbers</h3>
  <p>
    The $n$th triangle number is $T_n=1+2+3+...+n$, and we have the formula $T_n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. This can be proved rather elementarily, but let's do it in a more complicated way motivated from Ramanujan's manipulations. Firstly, we can define the function $p_n(x)=1+x+x^2+...+x^n$, which is equal to $p_n(x)=\frac{x^{n+1}-1}{x-1}$. Taking the derivative we get the equality
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    p'_n(x) &=& 1+2x+3x^2+...+nx^{n-1}\\
            &=& \frac{nx^{n+1}-(n+1)x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
    Note that $p_n'(1)=T_n$, the only issue is that we can't directly plug in $x=1$ into the above formula. Let $n=2N$ if it is ever and $n=2N+1$ if it is odd.  We then compute $p_n'(x)-2p'_N(x^2)$ to get
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    p_n'(x)-4p'_N(x^2) &=& 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
