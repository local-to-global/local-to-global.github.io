  <h3>Tangent Lines and Derivatives</h3>
  <p>
  Typically, if $f(x)$ is a function, then (if it exists), the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=a$ is typically defined a
  $$
  f'(a) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
  $$
    The Tangent Line at $x=a$ is then defined as the polynomial
    $$
    P(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
    $$
    This is the linear approximation for $f(x)$ at $x=a$. This suggests that it is the line passing through the point $(a,f(a))$ that approximates the function $f(x)$ around $x=a$ the best. Our question is then: Does this work in reverse? Can we define the Tangent Lines at $x=a$ to be the line that approximates $f(x)$ near $x=a$ and then recover the traditional definition for the derivative?
    </p>
    <p>
    To do this, we need to know what a "best approximating line" even means. Obviously such a line will have to pass through the point $(a,f(a))$ and so will be of the form $L(x)=f(a) + m(x-a)$ for some number $m$. For such a line, we have that
      $$
      \lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)-L(x) = 0
      $$
      This means that $L(x)$ approximates $f(x)$ to the 0th order at $x=a$. All this means is that they have the same value at $x=a$. To strengthen this, we should look towards a 1st order approximation of $f(x)$ at $x=a$. We have that $f(x)-L(x)$ goes to zero, and that $x-a$ goes to zero at $x=a$. If we divide them to get $\frac{f(x)-L(x)}{x-a}$, then we don't have to have this go to zero at $x=a$. If it does go to zero, then that implies that $f(x)-L(x)$ goes to zero faster than $x-a$ goes to zero, which implies a faster and better approximation. Towards this end, we make the definition:
    </p>  
    <div class = "thm"><b>Definition:</b> Let $f(x)$ be a function and $T(x)$ a line of the form $T(x)=f(a)+m(x-a)$. We say that $T(x)$ is a <b>Tangent Line</b> of $f(x)$ at $x=a$ if
      $$
      \lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)-T(x)}{x-a} = 0
      $$
    </div>
    <p>
      The main result is that there is at most one tangent line at any point. Furthermore, the slope of this unique tangent line is the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=a$. Therefore, the above definition of the tangent line is equivalent to the definition of the derivative. Yet is is a bit more conceptually motivated by the need to find good approximations. Let's state a prove this statement:
    </p>
    <div class="thm"><b>Theorem:</b> Let $f(x)$ be a function. There is at most one tangent line at any point for $f(x)$. Furthermore, if it exists, the slope of the tangnet line is given as
      $$
      f'(a) = \lim_{h\rightarrow} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
      $$
    </div>
    <div class="thm"><b>Proof: </b>
      <p>
      Let $O(x)=f(x)-L(x)$, we then obviously have 
    $$
    f(x) = f(a) + m(x-a) + O(x)
    $$
      We call this the "error" of the approximation. For any line $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}O(x)=0$. $L(x)$ is a tangent line if, additionally, $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{O(x)}{x-a}=0$.
      </p>
    <p>
      So let $L(x)$ be any line passing through $(a,f(x))$. Assume that the limit 
    $$
    \lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{O(x)}{x-a} = c
    $$
     also exists and equals $c$. With this assumption, we can write $O(x)=c(x-a)+o(x)$, where $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}o(x)/(x-a)=0$. We can plug this into $f(x)=f(a)+m(x-a) + O(x)$ to get
     $$
     f(x) = f(a) + M(x-a) +o(x)
     $$
     where $M=m+c$. If we set $T(x)=f(a)+M(x-a)$, the it is easy to check that $\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)-T(x)}{x-a} = 0$. So under the assumption that $\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{O(x)}{x-a}$ exists for some line $L(x)$, means that we can find at least one that satisfies the optimization condition of a tangent line.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will show that there is only a single tangent line by finding a formula for $M$. Taking the equation $f(x)=f(a)+M(x-a)+o(x)$ and solving for $M$ gives
     $$
     M = \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \frac{o(x)}{x-a}
     $$
     Note that the left side does not depend on $x$, so we are free to take the limit of this expression at $x=a$ without changing $M$. Since the limit of the second term on the right is zero, doing this then gives
     $$
     M = \lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}
     $$
     Which can be turned into the typical expression for the derivative through the change of variables $h=x-a$. 
     </p>
    </div>
     <p>
     This means that the definintions around all this are not ad hoc. The derivative arises naturally as the slope of the unique line that approximats a function the <i>best</i> around a point.
