    The number $\pi$ can seem to pop up in a lot of seemingly unrelated places. Of note, we have the formulas
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}  &=& \frac{\pi^2}{6}\\
    \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)! &=& \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\\
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}dx &=& \sqrt{\pi}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
    These are three of the most commonly cited instances of $\pi$ showing up where it "shouldn't". We'll show how all three of these have $\pi$ in them for the same reason. Some of the technicalities of this reason require some more advanced math, but it can be understood intuitively relatively easily. This reason is: Up to a "scale" $\sin(x)$ is only one "nice" function on the Complex Plane that equals zero at exactly the integers. That is, if $f(x)$ is some differentiable functions on the Complex Plane so that $f(n)=0$ for every integer $n$, and there are no other zeros, then $f(x)$ is some "scale" of $\sin(x)$.
