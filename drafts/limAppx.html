  Limits are probably the most important thing to learn in Calculus, conceptually and practically. Of particular importance is understanding the precise epsilon-delta definition of a limit. This is because limits provide us a roadmap to approximation through this explicit description, and approximation is one of the widely used ideas in math. To understand the connection between limits and approximation, we'll first look at approximation.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Approximation</h3>
  <p>
    Most values used in math are not going to be 100% precise. Whether you're measuring a value or using a physical/mathematical value, you're more than likely not using the actual value you claim. You're likely using another number that approximates it well enough. What does this mean? This means that you have taken a look at your problem and decided that using only the first few digits of $\pi$, or that you can just take the acceleration due to gravity to be $-9.8m/s$, and this will result in an answer that will work for the purposes you need. While you may mindlessly always use the approximation of $\pi$ that is automatically programmed into calculators, you're still doing this process implicitly and it can become important when you solve problems with more and more values. "Significant Digits" is a standardized way to do this that is effective, but is lacking.</p>
    <p>
    This means that the values are "close enough". The key to this is that the distance between the value you need and the value you use is small enough to not matter. Determining when a value is "close enough" then boils down to figuring out how far away from actual value you can live with. We can call this maximum distance the <stong>Error</strong> of the value, and we denote this using the character "$\epsilon$, which is an epsilon, which is the Greek character for "e" which stands for error. If we have a value $A$ that we would like to approximate within error $\epsilon>0$, then we just need to find some value $v$ so that the distance between $A$ and $v$ is less than $\epsilon$. Since $|x-y|$ is equal to the distance between $x$ and $y$, we can use the following equation to say "the distance between $A$ and $v$ is less than $\epsilon$":
    $$
    |v-A| < \epsilon
    $$
And this can be illustrated on the number line as
<img src ="">
</p>
<p> This gives us a notion of approximation:
<div class="thm"> <strong>Definition:</strong> If $A$ is number to be approximated, and $\epsilon>0$ the acceptable error that we can use in the approximation, then a value $v$ <strong>Approximates</strong> $A$ with error $\epsilon$ whenever 
$$
|v-A| < \epsilon
$$
</div>
As an example, if $A=\pi$, and the error is $\epsilon=0.01$, then the value $v_1=3.14$ is an approximation for $\pi$ within this error. If we want to push the error to be smaller, then we'll have to find better values to approximate with. If $\epsilon=0.001$, then we should use the value $v_2=3.141$. In this way, the error is closely linked to the number of digits you need to approximate a value. However, it should be noted that $v_2$ also approximates $\pi$ within error $0.01$.
</p>
<h3>Limits of Sequences</h3>
<p>
Ie: Infinitely accurate approximation. If we know that the value $v_1$ approximates a number $A$ within some error (and $v_1$ is not equal to $A$, which is usually the case), then we can always bump up the accuracy of the approximation, by lowering the error, until $v_1$ is no longer a good enough approximation. We could find another value $v_2$ that is within this new error, but we could do the same process: lower the error until $v_2$ no long approximates $A$ within the new error. We would then have to  find a new value $v_3$ etc. This can be illustrated in the image:
<img src="">
If we continue to do this, then we'll get a sequence of values $v_1,v_2,v_3,...$ that approximate $A$ with increasingly good accuracy. If, as we do this, the value of the error approaches zero, then this sequence will approximate $A$ with arbitrarily good accuracy. In this case, pick any error, no matter how small, and you'll be able to find some $v_n$ that is within this error. Moreover, since the approximation only gets better as we go along this sequence, if $k\geq 0$ then $v_{n+k}$ will also approximate it within this error.
</p>
<p>
There are a few things to point out in this process. The first is that we get to choose the error, and it can be as small as we like. Regardless of how small this error is, we'll always be able to find a value on our list that approximates it within this error. Moreover, any value that appears after this value will also approximate it within this error. Furthermore, if we decrease the error so that our value is no longer good enough, then there we know there will always be values later on down the list that are good enough. These are the basic ingredients for a limit.
</p>
<p>
  If $A$ is a number and $v_1,v_2,...$ are values so that, for large enough $n$, the $v_n$ approximate $A$ to any error $\epsilon$, no matter how small, then we say that $A=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}v_n$. Writing this out explicitly, we have
    <div class = "thm"><strong>Definition: </strong> let $v_1,v_2,v_3,...$ be an infinite sequence of values. If there is a number $A$ so that for any error $\epsilon > 0$ we can find an index $n$ any value appearing after $v_n$ approximates $A$ with error $\epsilon$, then we say that $A$ is the <strong>Limit</strong> of the sequence $v_i$.
      <br>
More explicitly, if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an index $n$ so that for all $N>n$ we have 
  $$
  |v_N-A| &lt; \epsilon
  $$
then we say that $A=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} v_n$.
    </div>
    This notion of a limit is the limit of a sequence, and the technical definition of it is a little easier to internalize than the one for limits of functions. Here it is clear that $\epsilon$ is playing the role of an error, and how the choice of an error determines which elements of the sequence can be used to approximate it within that error. This gives us a way to approximate individual values fairly concretely. As an example, consider the sequence
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    v_0 &=& 1\\
    v_1 &=& 1-\frac{1}{3}\\
    v_2 &=& 1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}\\
    v_3 &=& 1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}\\
    &\vdots&\\
    v_n &=& 1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+...+\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}\\
    &\vdots&
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
    This sequence famously has the limit $\pi/4 = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} v_n$. So now we have a concrete way to approximate $\pi$ to any required precision. First we choose some error $\epsilon>0$ that we can live with, then we know that we can find an $n$ so that $\pi \approx 4\left(1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+...+\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}\right)$, within that error. The issue for this then becomes: "How high does $n$ need to be for really small $\epsilon$?" and for this sequence, you need pretty large $n$ to get a good approximations. More modern math can find sequences where even the first few can approximate $\pi$ really well, so it takes a reasonable number of terms to compute $\pi$ to trillions of digits.
 </p>
  <p>
    We should then think of limits as roadmaps to approximation.
  </p>
  <h3>Limits of Functions</h3>
  <p>
    Limits of functions behave similar to limits of sequences. As before, we'll have a value that we are approximating, and be choosing errors and figuring out if the values that we have can approximate it or not. The only thing that changes is the range on the values that end up doing the approximating. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at the limits of sequences, what we were doing was picking an error, and then finding input values for the sequence that are "close enough to infinity" (ie large enough) so that the values are within that error. This means that a the limit $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}v_n =A$ if $v_n$ is "close enough" to $A$ whenever $n$ is "close enough" to infinity. Said another way:
    $$
    \textrm{If }n\textrm{ is close enough to infinity, then }v_n\textrm{ is close enough to }A
    $$
    This interpretation gives us some flexibility, particularly on the left side of this if-then statement. In particular, it frees us from having to use sequences, we can use anything that has a notion of "close enough" (admittedly vague at this point, but this will be cleared up). So let $a$ be any real number and $f(x)$ a function defined around $x=a$. We can then say that $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)=A$ if $f(x)$ is close enough to $A$ whenever $x$ is close enough to $a$. Or:
    $$
    \textrm{If }x\textrm{ is close enough to }a\textrm{, then }f(x)\textrm{ is close enough to }A
    $$
    To get our "roadmap to approximation", we need to make these notions explicit. We already know what "close enough to $A$" means, it means that the value is within the error $\epsilon$ that we choose. The notion of "close enough to $a$" will be similar. It will be determined by some acceptable deviation from $x=a$, denoted $\delta$. So $x$ is "close enough" to $a$ in this sense if $|x-a| &lt;\delta$. Since being able to plug in $x=a$ into the function is something not required, and often can't happen, we make the additional restriction that $0 &lt; |x-a| &lt; \delta$.
  </p>
  <p> We can then make a notion of approximation via a function:
  <div class="thm"><strong>Definition:</strong> If $A$ is a real number and $\epsilon>0$ is some fixed error, and $f$ is a function, then we say that the values around $x=a$ <strong>Approximate</strong> $A$ though $f$ if $x$ is close enough to $a$, then the value $f(x)$ approximates $A$ with error $\epsilon$. Explicitly, the values arouond $x=a$ approximate $A$ through $f$ if there is some acceptable deviation $\delta>0$ so that if $0&lt; |x-a| &lt; \delta$ then $|f(x)-A| &lt; \epsilon$.
  </div>
  <p> This can be illustrated by the images below:</p>
  <img src="">
  <p>The key to limits is then this working no matter how small you make the error. That is if the values around $x=a$ approimate $A$ through $f$ for any error that you could choose.
      <div class="thm"><strong>Definition:</strong> If $f$ is a function defined around a number $a$, and $A$ is some fixed value, then we say that $A$ is the <strong>Limit</strong> of $f(x)$ at $x=a$ if the values around $x=a$ approximate $A$ through $f$ to any arbitrary error. Explicitly, $A$ is the limit of $f(x)$ at $x=a$ if for any error $\epsilon >0$ there is some acceptable deviation $\delta>0$ so that 
        $$
        \textrm{If } 0 &lt; |x-\delta| &lt; \delta \textrm{ then } |f(x)-A| \&lt; \epsilon
        $$
  </div>
  <p> The $\delta$ is then an allowed deviation that still guarantees that $f(x)$ is within the given error of $A$, and it is determined by the $\epsilon$ in question.
