  <p>Special Relativity is great, has made a lot of verified predictions and fixed many problems plaguing physicists during the turn of the 20th century. But with any good theory, it raised a lot of questions. Many of these questions had to deal with gravity. Based on Newtonian gravity, the strength of the gravitational field is proportional to the masses involved and dependent on the distance between them. If we change the reference frame through which we observe the system, then the masses and the distances involved will change as prescribed by Special Relativity, this results in different things happening based on how fast you're looking at something, which is preposterous. Additionally, according to Newton, the gravitational field is communicated instantly. If the sun disappeared, we know about it instantly, even before the light stopped coming, because we would lose that gravitational force. This also violates Special Relativity. Just as Classical Mechanics didn't mix with Electromagnetism, resulting in Special Relativity, we find that Special Relativity and Gravity do not mix. So it needs to be fixed. Overall, both of Newton's biggest accomplishments are being fixed by Einstein.</p>
  <h3>The Principle of Equivalence</h3>
  <p>
  Einstein's main insight was that you cannot tell the difference between being pushed by gravity, and being accelerated upwards. Or, another way to put it, you can cancel out a gravitational force by just viewing things from a frame of reference that is, itself, accelerating. This is how the weightlessness in free-fall planes work (a la that OK-GO video). From the point of view of a camera on the plane, there is no gravity and everyone is floating, but from the reference point of the ground, the people are in free-fall and the plane is just accelerating with them as they fall. In one reference frame, there is gravity and in the accelerated frame, there is no gravity. This forms an equivalence between accelerated frames and the force of gravity, which serves as Einstein's jumping off point for General Relativity.
