  <p>Special Relativity is great, has made a lot of verified predictions and fixed many problems plaguing physicists during the turn of the 20th century. But with any good theory, it raised a lot of questions. Many of these questions had to deal with gravity. Based on Newtonian gravity, the strength of the gravitational field is proportional to the masses involved and dependent on the distance between them. If we change the reference frame through which we observe the system, then the masses and the distances involved will change as prescribed by Special Relativity, this results in different things happening based on how fast you're looking at something, which is preposterous. Additionally, according to Newton, the gravitational field is communicated instantly. If the sun disappeared, we know about it instantly, even before the light stopped coming, because we would lose that gravitational force. This also violates Special Relativity. Just as Classical Mechanics didn't mix with Electromagnetism, resulting in Special Relativity, we find that Special Relativity and Gravity do not mix. So it needs to be fixed. Overall, both of Newton's biggest accomplishments are being fixed by Einstein.</p>
  <h3>The Principle of Equivalence</h3>
  <p>
  Einstein's main insight was that you cannot tell the difference between being pushed by gravity, and being accelerated upwards. Or, another way to put it, you can cancel out a gravitational force by just viewing things from a frame of reference that is, itself, accelerating. This is how the weightlessness in free-fall planes work (like that OK-GO video). From the point of view of a camera on the plane, there is no gravity and everyone is floating, but from the reference point of the ground, the people are in free-fall and the plane is just accelerating with them as they fall. In one reference frame, there is gravity and in the accelerated frame, there is no gravity. This forms an equivalence between accelerated frames and the force of gravity, which serves as Einstein's jumping off point for General Relativity.
  </p>
  <p>
  The question then becomes: How do we get accelerated frames of references? Recall that if you are in 4D-Spacetime, then you can always view objects moving at the constant speed of light, but some of this speed is through time dimension so only part of it manifests as physical movement. If we are accellerating, then this means that we are "rotating" this speed from the time dimension into the space dimension. We can do this forcefully with rockets, but this should be equivalent to whatever gravity does. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If we just let an object go in a gravitational field, then it should start to accelerate on its own. What this means is that the direction its 4D speed is "pointing" needs to rotate a bit into the space dimension. This seemingly cannot happen on its own because if your motion is directed along the time direction in 4D space, then you'll travel in the time dimension, so you won't pick up physical speed. But this assumes that spacetime is "flat". But if it is warped, then some of the space-dimension could get in the way as you travel in the time dimension. While time may point straight ahead from the point you're at now, it may point a little bit at a an angle at a point just in front of you so as you move to that point, your 4D speed is no longer point only in the time dimension allowing you to pick up physical speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens, then, in curved spacetime is not you being accelerated by gravity, but the time dimension changing the direction that it's pointed in due to the curvedness, peeling away from you, forcing you to start moving in the physical dimensions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the general idea of General Relativity: Spacetime is a curved object, and this curvature results in motion and accelleration. 
    </p>
    <h3>Einstein's Equations</h3>
    <p>
      With this in mind, we need to figure out how spacetime curves and how to talk about this curvature.
    </p>
    <p> 
      At every point in this curved spacetime we can measure the "local distortion". If you have a 4D direction, then we can use the curvature to distort this direction to a new one and compare it to the old direction. The further this is from what we would expect if the space were flat, the more distored spacetime is. This gives us a metric with which to measure the curvature and we call it "The Metric".
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you have a mass, then we can try to talk about its gravitational pull when you're a distance $r$ from the center. There is a certan distance $R_s$ associated to this object, depending on its mass, called the Schwarzhild Radius, and the distortion is determinced by how far you  are from the center compared to the $R_s$. If you point in the time direction, then the distorted time direction is proportional to $(1-R_s/r)$ of the original. In particular, if $r=R_s$, then this is zero, and so the distorted time direction completely disappears. This means that any gravitational motion will have to be in the space direction, which cannot happen. This is the edge of a blackhole, and the dissapearance of the time direction suggests weird behavior that cannot be completely determined by general relativity.
    </p>
    <p>Everything that we need to know about the curved spacetime is encoded in this metric. The main result of Einstein is finding an equation that this metric must satisfy, given a configuration of mass, energy, etc. Karl Schwarzchild was the first person to solve these equations given a physical system. He did it while serving in the German army in WWI, he later died due to serving on the Russian Front before the end of the war.
