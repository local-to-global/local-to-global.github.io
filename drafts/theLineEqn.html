  One of the first things that a student learns in a high school algebra class, or even before, is that when the equatoin $y=mx+b$ is graphed, the result is a line. To understand this, the student might plug in some values for $x$ and plot some points on the graph and see that, indeed, they get a line. This is more than enough justification for students to begin working with line equations and to begin solving many different problems involving lines and equations. But this conclusion, that $y=mx+b$ or, more generally, $ax+by+c=0$ produce lines when graphed, is not really something that is immediately clear and is, in fact, a fundamental link between the algebra of equations and the Euclidean geometry of lines. What we want to investigate is why $ax+by+c=0$ makes a line and how this result is a bridge between algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.

  How do you even answer a question like "Why does $y=mx+b$ make a line?"? It seems like such a basic fact that it is just obvious. But this kind of common-sense stuff usually hides something interesting. In our case we actually need to make the bridge between algebra and geometry that makes analytic geometry so useful. So to begin, we need to know what we're working with. The basic object of interest is the coordinate plane. But definition, the coordinate plane begins with the standard Euclidean plane along with a pair of perpendicularly intersecting lines which are marked based on the signed distance from the origin, the point of intersection. We call one of these line the $x$-axis, and the other the $y$-axis. The point $(a,b)$ on the plane is then given by drawing the line parallel to the $y$-axis at the marked point along the $x$-axis at the signed distance $a$, and similarly we draw a line parallel to the $x$-axis at the point $b$ on the $y$-axis. The intersection point of these lines is $(a,b)$.

  This, perhaps overly terse, description of labeling coordinates on the coordinate axis is the mechanism of how geometry and algebra will interact: For every point we now can crate a pair of perpendicular lines. For instance, consider the graph of the equation $x=p$ for some fixed $p$. This is all points of the form $(p,y)$. If I plot one of these points, say $(p,b)$, then I will draw a vertical (ie, parallel to the $y$-axis) at the point $p$ along the $x$-axis. Any point on this line has the $x$-coordinate $x=p$ since any such point draws the same line
