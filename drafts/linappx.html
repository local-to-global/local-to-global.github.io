    <p>If $f(x)$ is a differentiable function, then its linear approximation at $x=a$ is
      $$
      f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
      $$
      But why? Why does this work? Understanding why this works is very closely tied to understanding how the definition for a derivative works. In fact, the fact that this linear approximation is the best possible way to approimate $f(x)$ near $f(a)$ with a line is a way that we could define the derivative! Let's unpack what this all means.
    </p>
    <h3>Derivatives and Linear Approximation</h3>
    <p>Firstly, the derivative of $f(x)$ is defined to be
      $$
      f'(a) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
      $$
      What this really means is that if we look at the expression $\epsilon(h)=f'(a)-\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$, a function of $h$, then we must have that $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \epsilon(h) = 0$. So if $h$ is "small", then so is $\epsilon(h)$. We can rearrange this formula to get
      $$
      f(a+h)=f(a)+f'(a)h -h\epsilon(h).
      $$
      This should look a little familiar. In fact, if we put $x=a+h$ and plug this in then we get $f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) - (x-a)\cdot\epsilon(x-a)$. Now, if $x-a$ is small, then so is $\epsilon(x-a)$, and means that their product is even smaller. It is, in fact, smaller than the other terms, so we can write $f(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a) + (\textrm{ Very Small })$ which is to say that near $x=a$ the function $f(x)$ is approxixmately equal to the line $f(x)+f'(a)(x-a)$. You can actually take this to be the definition of the derivative. It is the unique slope that approximates the function near the point.
    </p>
    <h3>Naive Differentials</h3>
    <p>The key thing about derivatives is that we have $f(a+\Delta x)=f(a)+f'(a)\Delta x$, at least within some error. If we put $\Delta f=f(a+\Delta x)-f(a)$, then this says that 
      $$
      \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} \approx f'(a)
      $$
    In fact, if you are willing to live with some given error, you can make this an equals sign. From this we can get an approximated version of the Chain Rule. If $F(x)=f(g(x))$ and we set $y=g(x)$, then
      $$
      F'(x) = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta y}\frac{\Delta g}{\Delta x} = f'(g(x))g'(x)
      $$
      And this works, at least within our error. Note that we got this by treating these as actual fractions, but it generally works as long as we are careful with out limits. In particular, we are treating $\Delta f$ and $\Delta x$ as we would $df$ or $dx$ in a non-math course. This gives us a little insight in how physicists and engineers typically use differentials. The precise and mathematical definition of them is very abstract, and requires higher level math to really understand, but we can give a naive definition for them that generally fits in with what is done in physics courses. We can say that "$df$" is the $\Delta f$ given by a $\Delta x$ that is small enough so that we can say that $\Delta f = f'(a)\Delta x$, while within our error. So if you see a physicist use $df$ non-rigorously, then it is likely that they are treating $df$ as a $\Delta f$ that is small enough so that the error inherent to the equation $\Delta f \approx f'(a)\Delta x$ is negligable. You actuall can treat these as fractions, and as long as you work with the nice functions you see in physics, then you won't encounter any issues if you just pretend that you take the limit to get the actual derivative later.
