    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>
      The objective of this post will be to study the general equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ and it's solutions (we'll assume that $a$ is not zero). In general, the graph $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is a parabola somewhere on the coordinate grid, and the solutions to the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are the $x$-values of the places where this parabola crosses the $x$-axis:

    <p>
      Most of us know, or have seen at some point, the solution to this problem in high school. Notably, the Quadratic Formula provides the $x$-coordinates for this:
      $$
      x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
      $$
      We won't be concerned with knowing the solution, but more focused on understanding this solution and how we get it from the equaion $ax^2+bx+c=0$. The Big Idea to obtaining this solution is to take advantage of an really easy problem. More specifically, it is really easy to solve the equation $x^2-D=0$, so what we'll be doing is transforming the general equation into an easy equation like this, solve the easy equation, and then transform the easy solution back so that it becomes a solution to the hard problem. This is a common way to solve problems in math, but it isn't really discussed explicitly too much. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate this, let's use this idea to make our problem a little bit easier on the eyes. Right now, we want to solve the equaion $ax^2+bx+c=0$, but this $a$ out front can be a real drag and make the formulas look really messy. Luckily, we can get rid of it. Specifically, let's pretend that we already know how to solve the equation $x^2+Bx+C=0$ and that the solution is 
      $$
      x = \frac{-B\pm\sqrt{B^2-4C}}{2}
      $$
      and that we now want to solve the general equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, where the leading coefficient $a$ can be something besides $1$. Note that if $x$ satisfies this equation, and we divide through by $a$, then $x$ will sill satisfy the resulting equation
      $$
      x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{c}{a}=0
      $$
      If we put $B=\frac{b}{a}$ and $C=\frac{c}{a}$, then we get the equation $x^2+Bx+C=0$ which we know how to solve. By dividing through by $a$, we have transformed the hard equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ into the easy equation $x^2+Bx+C=0$ that we already know the solution of. All that is left is to take the solution to the easy equation and turn it into a solution to the hard one. In this case, we just have to plug in $B=b/a$ and $C=c/a$ to transform the solutions
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
       \frac{-B\pm\sqrt{B^2-4C}}{2} &\rightarrow & \frac{-\frac{b}{a}\pm\sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2-4\frac{c}{a}}}{2} = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      Overall, then, we had a hard problem to solve, but we were able to transform it into an easy problem that we already knew how to solve, solved the easy equation, and then transformed the solution back to make it a solution to the hard equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now that we know how to solve $ax^2+bx+c=0$ given that we have a solution to $x^2+Bx+C=0$, we'll use a similar concept to find the solution to $x^2+Bx+C=0$: Find an easy problem that we can already solve, transform the hard problem to the easy problem, solve the easy problem, transform the solution to the easy problem back into a solution to the hard equation.
    </p>
    <h3>THE EASY PROBLEM</h3>
    <p> 
      In a way, the hard part of solving a problem using this idea is finding the easy problem that the hard problem can be transformed into. In our case, we note that it is actually really easy to solve the equation $x^2-D=0$, which appears to be a simple version of the hard one we're trying to solve. In particular, this easy problem has the two solutions 
      $$
      x=\pm\sqrt{D}
      $$
      (In fact, square roots are invented to be the solutions to such equations.) So we already have an easy problem and its easy solution. The big question then becomes how to transform the hard problem $x^2+Bx+C=0$ into the easy problem $x^2-D=0$. It is hard to see what needs to be done, or if anything can be done, by just looking at the equations, instead we can compare the graphs of an equation like $x^2+Bx+C=0$ to an equation like $x^2-D=0$.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, here are the graphs to a few equations of the form $x^2-D=0$, for $D=1,4,9$:
    </p>

    <p>
      Counter to this, here are the graphs to a few equations of the form $x^2+Bx+C=0$, for $B=-2,-1,0,1,2$ and $C=-2$ in each:
    </p>
    IMG
    <p>
      What appears to be the main geometric effect when $B$ becomes non-zero? What does $B$ do to the graph that makes it different from a graph like $x^2-D=0$?
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest change is the lateral motion. Changing $B$ makes the graph list up or down, but the main change is that it shifts the center of the parabola left and right. This is the key observation. The thing that makes $x^2-D=0$ easy to  solve is the fact that the $y$-axis passes right through the center of the parabola, and the thing that makes $x^2+Bx+C=0$ hard to solve is the fact that the $y$-axis and does not pass through the center of the parabola. It then seems like the way to turn the hard problem into the easy problem is to shift the $y$-axis around horizontally until it does go through the center of the parabola.
    </p>
    <h3>TRANSFORMING TO THE EASY EQUATION</h3>
    <p>
      How do we shift the $y$-axis on a graph horizontally? We do this by picking a new zero-point for the $x$-coordinate. In particular, if $h$ is some number, then to shift the $y$-axis so that its new position is at $x=h$, we need to change the coordinate $x$ into the new coordinate $x'=x-h$. The old $y$-axis is the vertical line $x=0$, and the new $y$-axis is the vertical line $x'=0$ and this happens exactly when $x=h$.
    </p>
    IMG ILLUSTRATION
    <p>
      So if we have the parabola $x^2+Bx+C=0$, then we can shift the $y$-axis to $x=h$ by changing $x$ to $x'+h$. This can also be though of as shifting the parabola to the "left" by $h$ (right if $h$ is negative). So if we draw the $y$-axis at $x=h$, then the new equation for the original parabola $x^2+Bx+C=0$ is $(x'+h)^2+B(x'+h)+C=0$, which "simplifies" to
      $$
      (x')^2 +x'(2h+B) + (C+Bh+h^2) = 0
      $$
      We know that the shift that puts the $y$-axis in the middle of the parabola will be the shift that makes the middle term disappear, since this will put it in the form $x^2-D=0$, which is a centered parabola. The shift $h$ that makes this happen is $h=-\frac{B}{2}$. Shifting by this $h$ results in the equation (after a little simplification):
      $$
      (x')^2 - \left(\frac{B^2}{4} - C\right) = 0
      $$
      Here is a picture of what we have done so far:
    </p>
      IMG
    <h3>SOLVING THE EQUATION</h3>
    <p>
      Shifting the $y$-axis lets us turn the equation $x^2+Bx+C=0$ into the "easy" equation $(x')^2 - \left(\frac{B^2}{4} - C\right) = 0$. This "easy" equation has the "easy" solution
      $$
      x' = \pm\sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4}-C}
      $$
      But this is a solution in the shifted coordinates that put the $y$-axis through the middle of the parabola. To get a solution to the original equation, we need to shift this easy solution back. We do this by noting that $x'=x+\frac{B}{2}$, since we had $x'=x-h$ and $h=-\frac{B}{2}$. So we can transform back by plugging in this reverse transformation:
      $$
      x+\frac{B}{2} = \pm\sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4}-C}
      $$
      Solving for $x$ then gives
      $$
      x = -\frac{B}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4}-C}
      $$
      which simplifies to the solution we gave earlier. But I like this form for the solution because you can see how we solved it through it. We solved the equation by performing the actions
      $$
      \textrm{Transform to Easy Problem } \rightarrow \textrm{ Solve Easy Problem } \rightarrow \textrm{ Transform the Easy Solution back to the Hard Problem}
      $$
      Each of these steps manifests itself in this form for the solution:
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      \textrm{Transform to Easy Problem: } && \frac{B^2}{4}-C\\
      \textrm{Solve the Easay Problem: } && \pm\sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4}-C}\\
      \textrm{Transform back to Hard Problem: } && -\frac{B}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4}-C}
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
          This is a solution to the Quadratic Formula that focuses on the concepts revolving around equations, including graphs and coordinates, and uses a general problem solving method that is very helpful for everything. This allows us to solve every quadratic equation $ax^2+b+c=0$ using only the solutions to equations of the form $x^2-D=0$. It is natural to ask whether or not any degree $n$-polynomial can be solved using only the solutions fo equations of the form $x^n-D=0$. This is true for $n=1,2,3,4$ but not true for any more degrees. This is far beyond elementary algebra to prove and is a pretty fundamental result in algebra and number theory. We can, however, find formulas like the quadratic formula for $n=3,4$, but these are much harder to arrive at as this method of shifting the equation to a better form only helps moderately.
