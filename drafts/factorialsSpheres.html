      Why is $\pi$ so related to factorials? For example, why do we have $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)! = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$?
    Factorials come up when counting permutations and they're what you get when you multiply the first few positive integers together. Pi is geometric and related to circles. What is the connection?
    </p>
    <p>
      To motivate, let us make a geometric connection that will give an alternative formula for the factorial. To make this connection, we will want to consider "$n$-Dimensional Simplexes". With $n=2$ on the plane, this is just the triangle obtained from the axis by connecting the diagonal line $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$. In 3 dimensions this is the 3D-object obtained by connecting the three points $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$ and $(0,0,1)$, along with the x,y and z planes. ????

  The traditional 3-dimensional unit ball is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy
  $$
  x^2+y^2+z^2\leq 1
  $$
  This can be easily generalized to higher dimensions by adding more components. The traditional $n$-dimensional unit ball is the set of points $(x_1,...,x_n)$ that satisfy
  $$
  x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2 \leq 1
  $$
  But these objects can be generalized in another way. This uses the traditional notion of Euclidean distance as determined by the Pythagorean Theorem. But if $p\geq 1$ is any positive integer, then we can create the $L_p$-unit ball in $n$ dimensions as the set of points $(x_1,...,x_n)$ satisfying
  $$
  |x_1|^p+|x_2|^p+\cdots +|x_n|^p =1
  $$
    Let $B_{n,p}$ denote such an object, and let $V_{n,p}$ be its volume. In the case $p=1$, the object is an $n$-dimensional version of an octahedron. But the volume of the $B_{n,1}$ is closely related to factorials. In particular, we have the formula
    $$
    V_{n,1} = \frac{2^n}{n!}
    $$
    What this does is allow us to find an alternative definition for the factorial, based on volume of the $L_1$-ball. There are many different formulas for the factorial, the number of permutations, the product of the first consecutive integers, or through a multiplicative recursion formula, and we can add to this list the factorial determined by these volumes:
    $$
    n! := \frac{2^n}{V_{n,1}}
    $$
    You can compute everything on the right-hand side independent of knowing what a factorial is, so this works as a definition of the factorial. The interesting thing what happens when we consider larger $p$.
    </p>
    <h3>Volumes of $L_p$ unit balls</h3>
    <p>
    We say that $V_{0,p}=1$ for all $p$ and set $\pi_p = V_{p,p}$. For a given $p$, we can relate $V_{n,p}$ to $V_{n-p,p}$ fairly directly through the formula
    $$
    V_{n,p}=V_{n-p,p}\frac{p\pi_p}{n}
    $$
    This follows from a change of variables in an integral, and the fact that we subtract out $p$ from $n$ is vital for this working out. When $n=kp$ is a multiple of $p$, this formula becomes
    $$
    V_{kp,p} = V_{(k-1)p,p} \frac{\pi_p}{k}
    $$
    This, along with $V_{0,p}=1$, is a recursion formula that allows us to compute
    $$
    V_{kp,p} = \frac{\pi_p^k}{k!}
    $$
    which is totally analogous to the $p=1$ case (since $\pi_1=2$). This, then, gives yet another working definition for the factorial:
    $$
    k! = \frac{\pi_p^k}{V_{kp,p}}
    $$
    But the very interesting thing about this formula is that the right side of this formula is valid for any $k$ so that $kp$ is an integer. That is, we can plug in $k=n/p$ for any integer $n$ and still have a computable and defined value on the right. This then gives us a way to define the factorial of any positive rational number:
    $$
    \left(\frac{n}{p}\right) ! = \frac{\pi_p^{n/p}}{V_{n,p}}
    $$
    It takes work to show that the value does not depend on our choice of denominator, but it is valid. This, then, is a formula for any rational factorial. As an example, $V_{1,p}=2$ for any $p$ and so
    $$
    \left(\frac{1}{p}\right) ! = \frac{\sqrt[p]{\pi_p}}{2}
    $$
    Which, of course, completely generalizes $(1/2)!=\sqrt{\pi}/2$. We can, further, define the Gamma Function on all positive real values by
    $$
    \Gamma(r) := \lim_{a/b\rightarrow r} \frac{\pi_b^{a/b}}{V_{a,b}}
    $$
    While this may be a super inconvenient formula for the Gamma Function, it is still interesting to see it done using volumes of generalized unit balls.
