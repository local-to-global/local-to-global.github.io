    We want to see what about the Bernoulli numbers makes them so important, from an elementary viewpoint. Our starting point will be their relationship to sums of consecutive powers $S_n(k) = 1^k+2^k+\cdots + n^k$.
    </p>
    <p>
      A difficulty in understanding these sums is that the only way to change $n$ is to add on another term to this sum, making the connection between two values of $n$ disconnected. We with to connect these. But we'll start by working with geometric series, for reasons that will be made clear shortly. Particularly define the functions
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      F(x,q) &=& \log(q) (q^{x-1} + q^{x-2} + \cdots )\\
      f_n(q) &=& q+q^2+q^3+\cdots +q^n
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      Using traditional methods of geometric series, these can be rewritten as
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      F(x,q) &=& \log(q) \frac{q^x}{q-1}\\
      f_n(q) &=& \frac{q^{n+1} - q}{q-1}
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      This allows us to create the formula $f_n(q) = \frac{1}{\log q} (F(n+1,q) - F(1,q))$. The reason this is interesting and relevant is that to change $n$ in $f_n(q)$ we would normally have to add on a whole new term to the sum, but this formula gives us a way to talk about the parameter $n$ is a continuous way, connecting the entries in this series of functions in a smooth way. We could define $f_x(q)= \frac{1}{\log q} (F(x+1,q) - F(1,q))$ and have the same sequence on integers. The important aspect of this, though, is that evaluation of $f_n(q)$ can be done by quickly computing values of the larger function $F(x,q)$. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We wish to use this connection to discuss the sum of consecutive integers. If $S_n(k)=1^k+2^k+\cdots n^k$, then we have
      $$
      S_n(k)\frac{t^k}{k!} = \frac{t^k}{k!} + \frac{(2t)^k}{k!} + \cdots \frac{(nt)^k}{k!}
      $$
      The $m$th term of this sum is the $k$th term in the power series for $e^{mt}$. We then have
      $$
      \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} S_n(k)\frac{t^k}{k!} = \sum_{m=1}^{n} e^{mt}
      $$
      Or, if $E_n(t)$ is the sum on the left, then $E_n(t) = f_n(e^t)$. So we have the relationship $E_n(t)=\frac{1}{t}(F(n+1,e^t)-F(1,e^t))$. If $B_n(x)$ is the coefficient of the Taylor series of $F(x,e^t)$ in the variable $t$, then we get
      $$
      S_n(k) = B_{k+1}(n+1)-B_{k+1}(1)
      $$

    What is so great about the Bernoulli numbers? They appear in a surprising number of places, especially in Number Theory. But why? We'll see the answer has to do with how they relate to a geometric series of exponential functions, and their importance is related to the behavior of this series.

    <h3>Sums of Powers</h3>
    <p>
    Consider the following function
    $$
    F(x,q) = \log(q) \left(q^{x-1}+q^{x-2}+q^{x-3}+\cdots\right) = \log(q) q^{x-1}\left(1+q^{-1}+q^{-2}+\cdots\right)
    $$
    which is just a geometric series in $q$ that has shifted terms. If $|q|<1$ then, by the expression for Geometric Series, this converges to
    $$
    F(x,q) = \frac{\log(q) q^x}{q-1}
    $$
    An important thing about this function is how it relates to the finite geometric sum $f_n(q)=q+q^2+\cdots+q^n$. Since we can write this as $f_n(q) = q\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$ it follows, from splitting up the sum in the numerator, that
    $$
    f_n(q) = \frac{1}{\log q} \left(F(n+1,q) - F(1,q)\right)
    $$
    This is cool because it expresses the finite family of functions $f_n(q)$ basically as values of $F(x,q)$. The key to this is that, up to scale and shift, increasing the first value of $F(n,q)$ is the same thing as adding on another term for the sum $q+q^2+\cdots + q^n$. Parameterizing the partial sums of a series into a function like this is pretty cool. We will be interested in using this to examine the sums $S_n(k)=1^k+2^k+\cdots+n^k$. Instead of looking at this single sum, we will fix $n$ and consider the family of sums $S_n(0),S_n(1),...$. The idea behind this is that we can create some nice Taylor series from this sequence of expressions due to the fact that we have
    $$
    S_n(k)t^k = t^k + (2t)^k + \cdots (nt)^k
    $$
    which is a homogeneity condition. With this in mind, we note that 
    $$
    S_n(k)\frac{t^k}{k!} = \frac{t^k}{k!} + \frac{(2t)^k}{k!} + \cdots \frac{(nt)^k}{k!}
    $$
    So if we construct the generating function $E_n(t):=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}S_n(k)\frac{t^k}{k!}$, then we can group the factors that have the same multipile of $x$ to get
    $$
    E_n(t) = \sum_{m=1}^n \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(mt)^k}{k!} = \sum_{m=1}^{n} e^{mt}
    $$
    So we have $E_n(t)=e^t+e^{2t}+\cdots+e^{nt}$, which should look familiar. If we set $q=e^t$ then we have $E_n(t)=f_n(e^t)$. Using what we learned earlier we then get
    $$
    E_n(t) = \frac{1}{t} \left( F(n+1,e^t) - F(1,e^t)\right)
    $$
    Since the Taylor series of $E_n(t)$ encodes the sums of powers up to $n$, this means that the coefficients in the Taylor series of $F(x,e^t)$ in the variable $t$ should have some arithmetic significance. Set $\mathcal{B}(x,t)=F(x,e^t)$ and set
    $$
    \mathcal{B}(x,t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}B_k(x)\frac{t^k}{k!}
    $$
    Combining our equations then gives
    $$
    S_n(k) = \frac{B_{k+1}(n+1)-B_{k+1}(1)}{k+1}
    $$
    This formula is based in the arithmetic properties of geometric series of exponential functions. 
                                                                               </p>
    <h3>Values of the Zeta Function</h3>
    <p>
      Relating the polynomials $B_k(x)$ to sums of powers is nice, but the real arithmetic significance comes from the relationship to the values of the Riemann Zeta Function. We'll work a little more generally and consider the Hurwitz Zeta Function:
      $$
      \zeta(s,b) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(m+b)^s}
      $$
      where $b>0$. This sum converges for $s>1$, but as we'll see, we can make sense of the values $\zeta(-n,b)$. Also, the Riemann Zeta Function is $\zeta(s)=\zeta(s,1)$, so results will translate. Intuitively, it looks like $\zeta(-n,b)$ is an infinite sum of the form $b^n+(1+b)^n+(2+b)^n+\cdots$, which obviously diverges. But it hints that if this does have a value, then it should be related to the values of $B_k(x)$. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To see how the Bernoulli Numbers relate to the Hurwitz Zeta Function, we will find an alternative construction for the function $\zeta(s,b)$ using the function $\mathcal{B}(x,t)$. The reconstruction of the zeta function will, of course, be tied to the properties of the exponential geometric series in $\mathcal{B}(x,t)$. Consider a typical term in the expression
      $$
      \mathcal{B}(1-b,t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} te^{-t(n+b)}
      $$
      It is of the form $te^{ty}$ for some $y$, so should have some nice integration properties. In particular, we will find an integral of these terms of the form $\frac{1}{y^s}\cdot A(s)$, where $A^(s)$ is some factor independent of $y$. This will be done through a change of variables along with the integral formula for the Gamma function:
      $$
      \Gamma(s) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t}t^{s-1}ds
      $$
