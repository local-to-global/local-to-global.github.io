  <p>Let $A$ be any positive real number and $n$ any positive integer. Then we define the $N$th power of $A$ to be:
  $$
  A^n = A\times A\times A\times\cdots \times A
  $$
  where there are $n$ "$A$s". The definition makes sense when $n$ is any positive integer, but exponents can be practically anything, and this formula doesn't work for negative powers, fractional powers or irrational powers. You can't put in half an $A$ into this formula. So how do we do it?
 </p>
 <h3>The Additive Rule</h3>
 <p>
 Before we can see how to extend this definition of exponentiation to other powers, we need to know an important formula that is, arguably, the whole reason that exponentiation is important, useful and interesting. This formula is the Additive Rule for exponents. It says that if $n$ and $m$ are any two positive integers, then we have
 $$
 A^{n+m} = A^n\times A^m
 $$
Try to prove this using nothing more than the definition above! This means that addition in the exponent turns into multiplication of the whole exponents. That is, it turns addition into multiplication. This has important theoretical properties, as we can transform properties of addition into properties of multiplication, but this is also what makes classical formulas involving exponents useful. Things like compound interest and radioactive decay end up working out so nicely precisely because of this property. More important than being "repeated multipliction", exponentiation obeys the Additive Rule. So if we are going to be extending exponentiation to allow for a larger pool of possible powers, then we should be sure that this extension also obeys the additive rule. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Any extension that does not obey the additive rule is useless and shouldn't really be considered a type of "exponentiation". Going forward, then, our general strategy will be to introduce a new type of number, like negative numbers, and then assume that exponentiation of negative numbers is defined (even though it isn't yet), and then use the additive rule to manipulate the equations to find a formula for the new type of exponentiation wholly in terms of exponents that we already know. This will work for integers, fractions and complex numbers, the real numbers will use different ideas about the real numbers to extend it.
 </p>
 <p>
 And there often are short little tricks to "see why" things like negative exponents are defined as they are, but these function more as a way to stop people from asking the question about why these powers are defined as they are, and don't introduce new mathematical ideas that can help us ask more question. And answer that doesn't lead to more questions is a bad answer.
 </p>
 
 <h3>Zero and Negative Powers</h3>
 <h4>Zero Powers</h4>
 <p>
 The first thing we need is to know what a zeroeth power is. That is, if $A$ is a positive real number, what should $A^0$ be? More precisely, what constraints does the additve rule put on the value of $A^0$? To figure this out, let's assume that $A^0$ has a value, we'll then use the additive rule to find a formula telling us what that value should be. This will be done by finding two values for $A^{0+1}$. On one hand, we can just add the exponents, and so we have
 $$
 A^{0+1}=A^1=A
 $$
Simple. On the otherhand, we can assume that the additive rule holds for this new power to split up the addition into multiplication:
$$
A^{0+1} = A^0\times A^1 = A^0\times A
$$
What this means is that $A^0\times A = A$. We can isolate the term $A^0$ in this equation by dividing through by $A$, this leaves us with
$$
A^0=1
$$
Therefore, whenever $A$ is a positive real number, we get that $A^0=1$. In fact, this works with negative $A$ as well, but negative $A$ will not work later on so we won't be considering it. Another thing to note is that because we had to divide through by $A$ to get $A^0=1$, this method does not work for $A=0$. Indeed, $0^0$ is an undefined quantity and has different values based on what context you're in, none is more correct than the other, just different. Finally, it is no coincidence that the a zero power is equal to 1. Addition by zero changes nothing, and multiplication by 1 changes nothing and since exponentitation changes one the other, it makes sense that $A^0=1$. This kind of behavior is common when working with functions that transform one kind of arithmetic to another.
</p>
<h4>Negative Powers</h4>
<p>
Knowing that $A^0=1$ will allow us to figure out what $A^{-n}$ needs to be. The strategey will be the same: Assume that negative powers actually mean something, then use the additive formula to figure out what they should be. Towards this end, let $A$ be a positive real number and $n$ a positive integer. If we assume that $A^{-n}$ makes sense, then we can use the addiive formula to examine the expression $A^{n-n}$. As above, we get the two formulas, one just adding the exponents, and the other using the additive formula to turn the addition into multiplication:
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
A^{n-n} &=& A^0\\
        &=& 1\\
A^{n-n} &=& A^{n}\cdot A^{-n}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
Overall this means that $A^{n}\cdot A^{-n}=1$. Since $A$ is nonzero, $A^n$ is nonzero, so we can divide through by $A^n$ to isolote $A^{-n}$. This gives
$$
A^{-n} = \frac{1}{A^n}
$$
As before, this only works for nonzero $A$. And, again, it is no coincidence that subtraction behaves as division. This is a consequence of what the additive rule allows, and you see this, too, in more abstract contexts.
</p>
<h3>Fractional Powers</h3>
<p>
We have, so far, used the additive rule for exponents to make sense of $A^{n}$ when $A$ is any positive real number and $n$ is any integer, be it positive, negative or zero. The natural thing to ask is then if we can make sense of fractional, or rational, powers. That is, if $n$ and $m$ are integers (with $m\ne 0$) what should $A^{n/m}$ be? We're going to play the same game here as we did before: Assume that $A^{n/m}$ makes sense, and use the additive rule to find a formula that tells us how it can make sense.
</p>
<p>
To really understand the formula, we need to use the additive rule to get another rule. The additive rule says that $A^{2n}=A^nA^n=(A^n)^2$. We can repeat this process as many times as we like and we'll get that for any pair of integers $n,m$ that
$$
A^{nm}=(A^n)^m
$$
This tells us how multiplication interacts with exponentiation and is a consequence of the additive rule. We can use this to figure out what fractional powers should be.
</p>
<p>
So assume that $A^{n/m}$ makes sense. Using this new rule we can explore the expression $A^{(n/m)m}$ and figure out what $A^{n/m}$ should be. As before, we'll evaluate the term in the exponent independent of any rules to get something we alread know, and then use the additive rule to get an expression involving the new term. In particular:
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
A^{(n/m)m} &=& A^{nm/m}\\
           &=& A^n\\
A^{(n/m)m} &=& (A^{n/m})^m           
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
So we have $(A^{n/m})^m = A^n$. This means that $x=A^{n/m}$ is a solution to the equation $x^m=A^n$. The only issue here is that there are $n$ solutions to this equation. But, luckily, we have an extra hint about what $A^{n/m}$ should be. So far, every power we've worked with has taken a positive number $A$ and output some other positive number. This suggests that $A^{n/m}$ should be a positive number. We, in fact, find that there is exactly one solution to $x^m=A^n$ that is also a positive number. In particular $x=\sqrt[m]{A^n}$ is the only positive, real solution to $x^m=A^n$ (this is how these roots are defined). It then follows that we should have $A^{n/m}=\sqrt[m]{A^n}$. This is how fractional powers and nth-roots become equivalent. One is defined through extending exponentiation and the other is defined through solutions to equations, the additive rule then shows us that they should be the same. 
</p>
<h3>Real Powers</h3>
<p>Extending exponentiation to real powers is different than the others, in that we are going to take a different route. Though there are some high-level similarities. In particular, for each extension we've taken a defining characteristic of the new numbers involved and then related this to powers we already knew. For $A^0$, it was the fact that $0+n=n$ for all positive integer $n$. For negative powers it was that if $-n$ was negative, then $n-n=0$. For fractions, it was the fact that $n/m$ is the unique number $x$ so that $xm=n$, ie multiplication by the integer $m$ gives the integer $n$. In a similar way, we will be using a defining charactersitic of the reals to extend exponentiation. The main difference is that the mechanism for this extension is the geometry of the real numbers, rather than an explicit arithmetic property of the reals. Though, it should be mentioned, that the additive rule does play a part, just at a higher and more technical level. We wouldn't be able to define real exponentiation as we are going to without it, but it isn't the main motivator
</p>
<p> The important thing we will be using is that if $r$ is any real number, then there are rational numbers that get infinitely close to $r$. Explicitly, there is a sequence of rational numbers $q_1,q_2,1_3,...$ that get closer and closer to $r$. We can then say that $A^r$ is whatever number that the sequence $A^{q_1},A^{q_2},A^{q_3},...$ gets closer and closer to. </p>
<p>
For example, the sequence $3,3.1,3.14,3.141,3.1415,...$ gets closer and closer to $\pi$, and so the values 
$A^3, A^{3.1},A^{3.14},A^{3.141},A^{3.1415},...$ is a sequence of rational powers that gets closer and closer to $A^{\pi}$.
</p>
<p>
If we know calculus, then we can say that if $r$ is a real number, then $A^r$ is defined to be $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}A^{q_n}$ whenever $q_n$ is a sequence of rational numbers so that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}q_n=r$. Proving that everything here works out requires more work, but this is the definition and it does, indeed, work. This also ensures that exponentiation $f(x)=A^x$ is a continuous function. So we extend exponentiation to the reals by filling in the holes in the exponentiation curve left by the rationals, just and the real line is what we get by filling in the holes on the number line left by the rationals.
</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
We are able to extend exponentiation starting from the "repeated multiplication" definition all the way to real numbers by taking advantage of certain properties of exponentiation and our new numbers. Importantly, we used the additive rule execessively. This method will also work for complex exponents, but that requires its own post.
