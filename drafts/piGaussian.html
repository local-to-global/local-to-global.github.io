    The Gaussian Integral is the integral
    $$
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}
    $$
    People are sometimes surprised to see a $\pi$ pop up in this, but we'll see that it comes quite naturally from the functional properties of the function $f(x)=e^{-x^2}$. 
    </p>
    <h4>A General Gaussian Integral</h4>
    <p>
      We will mimic the traditional proof of the Gaussian Integral, which can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral#By_polar_coordinates">Here</a>, but in a  more general setting. In particular, let $f(x)$ be a strictly positive function that has finite integral over the real line and satisfies the functional equation
      $$
      f(x)f(y)=G(r)
      $$
      for some positive function $G(r)$ and $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^}$. Note that $f(x)=e^{-x^2}$ satisfies $f(x)f(y)=f(r)$, so it is of this type. Let $I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx$ and $A = \int_0^{\infty}G(x)xdx$. We can compute $I$ to be a multiple of $\sqrt{\pi\cdot A}$.  We have
      $$
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      I^2 &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)f(y)dxdy\\
          &=& \int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi} f(x)f(y)rdrd\theta\\
          &=& \int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi} G(r)rdrd\theta\\
          &=& 2\pi \int_0^{\infty} G(r)rdr\\
          &=& 2\pi  A
      \end{eqnarray*}
      $$
      Since everything is positive, we have $I=\sqrt{2\pi \cdot A}$. We can then see that it is the angle invariance of the function $F(x,y)=f(x)f(y)=kf(r)$ that produces this pi. So it necessarily comes from the functional properties of the function in question.</p>
    <p>
      A natural question then is: What functions satisfy the functional equation $f(x)f(y)=G(r)$?
    </p>
    <h4>Finding the Gaussian</h4>
    <p>
      We seek to find the functions, $f(x)$, so that  $f(x)f(y)$ is invariant of the angle $\theta$. We will assume that $G(r)$ is differentiable and that $f(x)$ is nonconstant. The invariance on $\theta$ can then be expressed as:
      $$
      \frac{\partial G}{\partial \theta} = 0
      $$
      Note that if $F(x,y)$ is any function, then
      $$
      \frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta}
      $$
      And since $x=r\cos(\theta)$ and $y=r\sin(\theta)$, then $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta}=-y$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta}=x$. Using all this then means that
      $$
      0 = -f'(x)f(y)y + f(x)f'(y)x
      $$
      Rearranging gives
      $$
      \frac{f'(x)}{xf(x)} = \frac{f'(x)}{xf(x)}
      $$
      Since the left side depends only on $x$ and the right only on $y$, it follows that there is some constant $c$ so that
      $$
      f'(x)=2cxf(x)
      $$
      The solution to this differential equation is
      $$
      f(x) = ke^{cx^2}
      $$
      for some constant $k$. What this means is that, not only does the angle invariance of $f(x)f(y)$ give us a pi in our formula, but the only function that will satisfy this invarance are these Gaussian-like functions. Saying that a function $f(x)$ is so that $f(x)f(y)$ is independent of the angle is equivalent to saying that $f(x)$ is Gaussian. So the Gaussian has a definition in terms of circles, so the pi should not be mysterious.
