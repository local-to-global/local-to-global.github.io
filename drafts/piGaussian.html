  People are generally surprised to see the formula
  $$
  \int_{\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx =\sqrt{\pi}
  $$
    Why is there a $\pi$ there? In a previous post, we have discussed some pretty abstract reasons why this should happen. But we can look at this equation in particular and see how the functional properties of $e^{x^2}$ necessitate pi.
    </p>
    <p>
    Consider a differentiable function $f(x)$ that is positive everywhere. If $(x,y)$ is a point on the coordinate grid, then we can consider the value $f(x)f(y)$. In particular, what happens when $f(x)f(y)=kf(r)$, where $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and $k$ is some constant? This is a functional equation and it allows us to evaluate the integral of $f(x)$ rather nicely. If this is the case, then we can evaluate the integral rather nicely. If we set $I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx$, then we get
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    I^2 &=& \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx\right)\cdot \left(\int_{\infty}^{\infty}f(y)dy\right)\\
    &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)f(y)dxdy\\
    &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}kf(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})dxdy
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
    Transforming this into polar coordinates then gives
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    I^2 &=& k\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi}f(r)rd\theta dr\\
    &=& 2\pi k\int_0^{\infty}f(r)rdr
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
    This means that the integral $I$ will equal (plus or minus) the square root of $2\pi k$-times the radial integral. That is
    $$
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx = \sqrt{2\pi k} \left(\int_0^{\infty}f(x)xdx\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
    $$
    If there is no $\pi$ in the integral of $f(x)xdx$ or $k$, then the integral of $f(x)dx$ will necessarily have a $\pi$ in it. So what functions satisfy the equation $f(x)f(y)=kf(r)$?
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's talk a bit more generally: What are the functions $f(x)$ so that $f(x)f(y)$ is independent of the angle of the point $(x,y)$ in the coordinate plane. So, which functions $f(x)$ are so that $f(x)f(y)$ only depends on the distance $(x,y)$ is from the origin? We'll assume differentiability, so we can consider then
    $$
    \frac{d}{d\theta}f(x)f(y) = 0
    $$
    Note that since $x=r\cos(\theta)$ and $y=r\sin(\theta)$, we get $\frac{dx}{d\theta} = -y$ and $\frac{dy}{d\theta}=x$. Using the chain rule, we can evaluate this derivative:
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{d}{d\theta}f(x)f(y) &=& \frac{\frac{dx}{d\theta}f'(x)f(y) + \frac{dy}{d\theta}f(x)f'(y)}{(f(x)f(y))^2}\\
    &=& \frac{-yf'(x)f(y) + xf(x)f'(y)}{(f(x)f(y))^2}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
    For the derivative to be zero, we then just need $xf(x)f'(y)=yf'(x)f(y)$. Rearranging this, we get 
    $$
    x\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} = y\frac{f(y)}{f'(y)}
    $$
    so the value $x\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}$ is independent of the value $x$ that we input, so there is some constant $c$ so that such a function satisfies the differential equation
    $$
    f'(x) = cxf(x)
    $$
    The similarity to the equation $f'(x)=cf(x)$ should be noted, and this equation is the "infinitesimal" version of the additive formula $h(x+y)=h(x)h(y)$ that defines and makes exponential functions so important. In fact, the change of variables $x=\sqrt{t}$, while noting that $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{1}{2x}$, shows that
    $$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{df(x)}{dt} &=&  f'(x)\frac{dx}{dt}\\
    &=& cxf(x)\frac{dx}{dt}\\
    &=& \frac{c}{2} f(x)
    \end{eqnarray*}
    $$
    That is, if $F(t)=f(\sqrt{t})$, then $F'(t) = \frac{c}{2}f=F(t)$, which is the "infinitesimal" additive formula. So $F(t)=ke^{ct/2}$. What this means is that we must have $f(x) = ke^{Cx^2}$ for some constance $k$ and $C$. 
    </p>
    <p>
    So imposing just angle independence on $f(x)f(y)$ requires us to get a Gaussian-type function. On the other hand, if $f(x)=ke^{Cx^2}$, then we will get $f(x)f(y)=kf(r)$ since we have $x^2+y^2=r^2$. In a way, then $f(x)f(y)=kf(r)$ can be thought of as a "Multiplicative Distance Formula".
    </p>
    <p>
    Because the Gaussian is the unique type of function whose 2D product is angularly independent, it follows that we necessarily get the $\pi$ as a consequence of this independence.
