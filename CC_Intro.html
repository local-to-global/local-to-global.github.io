  “For what do you hunger, Lord?” Moneo ventured.<br>
“For a humankind which can make truly long-term decisions. Do you know the key to that ability, Moneo?”<br>
“You have said it many times, Lord. It is the ability to change your mind.” <br>

The old woman said: "You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind,"<br>
The itch became the faintest of burning. "Why are you doing this [the Gom Jobbar]?"<br>
"To determine if you're human."

<p> <i>Dune</i>, the series as a whole, is the story a single person who alone truly understands the danger of the inherent short-sightedness of humanity, and the struggle of this person to try to save humanity from this flaw. This person has a Terrible Purpose and takes on an extreme burden and sacrifices themselves to put humanity on the right path. The "Golden Path". 
</p>
<p> It seems that, even if not intended by Frank Herbert, this is a real-life allegory for the scientific community today. The short-sightedness that we are all born with has left us with an unnatural world, and social, political, and economic systems in place to sustain and develop it. The inability for humankind to recognize and solve truly long-term problems has resulted in the Kralizec ("final battle") known as Climate Change. In order for humanity to survive this "Gom Jabbar", and prove its "humanity". We must take this threat seriously and enact plans and make sacrifices to solve this problem, whose solution and consequences of inaction will only manifest many years after we are all gone.
</p>
<p>Scientists are the first to understand what is happening, resulting in the Terrible Purpose to put humanity on its Golden Path. Unfortunately, unlike the protagonist "Leto Atreides II" of the <i>Dune</i> series, scientists are not semi-immortal sandworms that can rule all humanity for 3,500 years. However, like Leto II, scientists do have prescient visions of the future, called the Scientific Method, that allow them to understand the larger threats to humanity and the steps needed to get onto the narrow Golden Path. 
</p>
<p> While not a climate scientist myself, I have this Terrible Purpose. This frustrating imperitive to help humanity do something that it needs, does not want, and listens to with a closed mind, with the alternative being the fate of watching the slow death of our species, knowing that someting could have been done. I do feel like address the main root-causes of Climate Change in my job. It is closedmindedness, stubbornness, and the inability to solve large-scale problems (bigger than one's entire life) that got us here and, potentially, will keep us in this prediciment. My job is to directly teach the problem-solving mindsets needed to recognize a problem and do something about it, even if it seems difficult. While we do need to put our hope in the next generation, it does not saciate my Terrible Purpose to be so limited in audience. Older people are quick to dismiss and ignore the warnings from scientists by appealing to nonexistent "depates" about well-agreed upon aspects of Climate Change. It is this ignorance and apathy of the older generations that is the most frustrating and it results in dangerous inaction towards Climate Change.</p>
<p>
This is my attempt at addressing this aspect of my Terrible Purpose, or maybe just venting frustration that people use the same tired, old, long-debunked arguments as excuses not to care about Climate Change. I'm not going to do this by directly addressing denier's arguments, because that perpetuates the illusion that there is a debate (something that benefits deniers and is a strategy used by corrupt oil companies), but by pulling different resources together and just explaining different aspects of the science behind what is happening. The more people are exposed to the unbiased science, the more vocabulary they have about what is real, the less that they will fall prey to the brainwashing propeganda that is Fox News and other anti-intellectual outlets.
