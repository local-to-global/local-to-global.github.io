  <h3>Tangent Lines and Derivatives</h3>
  <p>
  The heard of Calculus is Approximation, and the objects of Calculus are Functions. This means that Calculus can be thought of as the study of functions using tools of approximation. One particular strategy for this kind of study are methods to approximate functions with simple functions, particularly polynomials. It turns out, that when we try to understand functions through this lens, derivatives pop out as natural objects of interest.

  <h4> Functions are Hard</h4>
  <p>
  There are only a few functions that we can write down and work with. These are lines, quadratics, and higher degree polynomials, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, and a splattering of other functions like the absolute value. This is, however, a small collection of functions and while we can combine and compose these functions, almost every function is still out of our reach. Even the functions that we're interested in cannot be constructed from the familliar functions that we can easily work with.
  <p>
  This is a bit of a problem because we use functions for everything. Predicting sales of a product. Encoding valuable information through hash functions. The AI control of devices. Machine Learning algorithms. COVID-19 data curves. The Stock Market. The various aspects of Climate Change. All of these are uses of functions for very important things, and we can write down none of these functions. We can sometimes write down rules that these functions have to obey, though even this can be quite inaccessible, but this doesn't mean we can directly access the functions themselves. They're too complex and too hard.
  </p>
  <p>
  Regardless, however, this doesn't mean that we can't say anything meaningful about these functions. One way to study a hard function is to take a class of functions that we do know, like polynomials, and to approximate the function in question using them. If we can find the cubic polynomial which best approximates a function of interest, then we can use this cubic, an easy function, as a stand-in for the hard function (as long as we're careful). This is the idea behind a lot of analysis found in Calculus.

<h4>Tangent Lines</h4>
  
  Lines are particularly simple to work with, and most functions look like straight lines when you zoom in enough, 
    
    
    
    
    -Logarithmic derivative as an approximating exponential
    -Trigonometric Diff
    -Jump Differentiable (2nd diff)
