    The Riemann Zeta Function governs the behaviour of the primes and how they are distributed through Euler's Formula
    $$
    \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}
    $$
    which is valid for all complex numbers $s$ whose real part is larger than $1$. In general, however, this defines function that is meromorphic on the entire complex plane. This function has known zeros at ever negative even integer, $\zeta(-2n)=0$, and possible zeros in the region $0\leq \textrm{Re}(s)\leq 1$ but also a pole at $s=1$. The zeros get a lot of glory, due to the Riemann Hypothesis which says that the zeroes in the afformentioned region are actually all on the line $\textrm{Re}(s)=1/2$, but it is the pole that determines a lot of the properties of primes. This is what we will be interested in looking at. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In particular, we will be concerned with how the existence of this pole determines that there are infinitely many primes, that the connection with the Harmonic Series determines the rate at which the sum $\sum_p\frac{1}{p}$ diverges, and how this can give us a bound on the growth of primes. Additionally, we'll look at Merten's more refined look at this sum. Finally, we'll see how the poles and zeros explicitly determine the growth of primes, and how the pole is the main driving force and how the Riemann Hypothesis is really the hypothesis that the zeros don't mess things up too much.
    </p>
    <h3>The Infinitude of Primes</h3>
    <p> The first thing that we can learn about primes from the pole of the Riemann Zeta Function is that there are infinitely many of them. As mentioned, for any $s$ whose real part is larger than $1$, we have Euler's Product Formula. In particular, we must have 
    $$
    \lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s} = \lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}
    $$
    At this point, it is tempting to just say that the left side of this equation must be infinity, since $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}=\infty$, but this makes the assumption that the infinite series is valid even in the limit. In other words, it assumes that we can switch the limits: $\lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{n^s} = \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\lim_{s\rightarrow 1^+}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n^s}$, which isn't necessarily true. Though, it does turn out that we can do it in this case. In particular, we know that 
    $$
    \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}
    $$
    Since the sum on the left is the harmonic series, it follows that the limit is infinity. We therefore have $\prod_p(1-p^{-1})^{-1}=\infty$ where the product is over all primes. Since each individual term is finite, the only way that this can be infinite is if there are infinitely many primes. We then have our first, basic, result that shows how the primes are goverend by this pole.
    </p>
    <h3> The Divergence of the Sum of Reciprocal Primes</h3>
    <p>
    The above is fairly simple, and all we can do is conclude that there are infinitely many primes. If, however, we use the formula $\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}$ to figure out the rate at which these expressions diverge, we can learn a bit more explicit information about the distribution of primes. Note that the equality of these limits means that 
      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n} = \prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}} + o(N)
      $$
      where $o(N)$ represents some function that goes to zero as $N$ goes to infinity. 
    </p>
    <p> The first thing to note is that $\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{n}$ grows like $\log(N)$. This can be seen by comparing the sum to an integral of $\frac{1}{x}$. Explicitly this is expressed as $\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{1}{n} = \log(N)+O(1)$, which means that the difference between the sum and the log is bounded. This is a statement about the behavior of the zeta function as it approaches the pole. Given this neat asymptotic approximation for the partial sums in the harmonic series, we need to figure out an expression for the partial products in the prime expression. Combining this with the above means that
      $$
      \prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}} = \log(N) + O(1)
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards this end, we are going to take a logarithm so that we can turn this product into a sum. This looks like
      $$
      \log\left(\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right) = -\sum_{p\leq N}\log(1-p^{-1})
      $$
      We can expand the logarithms as a power series and get
      $$
      \log\left(\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right) = \sum_{p\leq N} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{p^{-k}}{k} = \sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p} +\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\sum_{p\leq N}\frac{p^{-k}}{k}
      $$
      The important thing about this is that the final double-sum converges as $N\rightarrow\infty$. In particular, we have that $\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{p^{-k}}{k} \leq \frac{1}{2p^2}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{p^k}$ from which we can extract a geometric series. This means that for every $p$ this term is bounded above by $\frac{1}{2p(p-1)}$. Summing over all $p\leq N$ is less than summing $\frac{1}{2n(n-1)}$ over all $n>1$ which is convergent and the bounds on this convergence are independent of what $N$ was. We can then conclude that
      $$
      \log\left(\prod_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right) = \sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p} + O(1)
      $$
      And combining this with what we learned above, we can say that 
      $$
      \sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p} = \log\log(N) + O(1)
      $$
      This shows that the growth of the series at the pole can help us determine how fast this particular sum of primes diverges. We can in fact do more. We can use this to get a statement about how the primes themselves grow. In fact, using this we can prove through the Euler-Maclaurin Formula that if $p_n$ is the $n$th prime
      $$
      1\leq \liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{p_n}{n\log n} \leq \limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{p_n}{n\log n} &lt; \infty
      $$
       Which means that $p_n$ grows not too much faster or slower than $n\log n$. In reality, the limit of $\frac{p_n}{n\log n}$ exists and is equal to $1$, so this is a good step in that direction. If $\pi(x)$ is the number of primes less than $x$, then we get the related result
      $$
      1 \leq\liminf_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\pi(x)}{x/\log(x)} \leq \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\pi(x)}{x/\log(x)} &lt; \infty
      $$
      This means that $\pi(x)$ grows not too differently from $\frac{x}{\log x}$.

    <h3>The Riemann-von Mangoldt Explicit Formula</h3>
    <p>
      The real importance of this pole, and the zeros, of the Riemann Zeta Function really come to fruition in the Riemann-von Mangoldt Explicit Formula. This arises from the Euler Product of the Riemann Zeta Function, which links it to the primes and their distribution, and the fact that the zeta function is meromorphic on the complex plane, along with the result that meromorphic functions are mostly determined by their zeros and poles. This gives us two ways to express the zeta function as infinite products:
      $$
      \prod_p\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} = \zeta(s) = \frac{e^{a+bs}}{s-1}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(1+\frac{s}{2n}\right)e^{-s/2}\prod_{\rho}\left(1-\frac{s}{\rho}\right)e^{s/\rho}
      $$
      where the final product on the right side is over all zeros in the critical strip. The expression on the right is the meromorphic equivalent of writing a polynomial in terms of its zeros. Note that the pole is apparent from this expression due to the $s-1$ in the denominator. Overall this has three main parts: 1) The pole, 2) The Trivial Zeros at $s=-2n$ and 3) The Non-Trivial Zeros. These will contribute to the distribution of primes via this equation in three different ways. The pole will be end up being the most dominant term, the trivial zeros will not contribute anything asymptotically and the non-trivial zeros will be responsible for the noise of the primes in their distribution and is the most mysterious part of this puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
     We can manipulate this equation to explicitly link the distribution of primes with the zeros and pole. How this is done is by first looking at the logarithmic derivative $\zeta'(s)/\zeta(s)$, which turns all these products into sums, and then performing an integral transform that picks out only relevant information. The end result is
      $$
      \sum_{p^n &lt; x} \log p = x - b - \frac{1}{2}\log(1-x^{-2}) - \sum_{\rho}\frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}
      $$
      The sum on the right is the Chebyshev function $\psi(x):= \sum_{p^n &lt; x} \log p$ and it is, essentially, a smoothed out version of the prime counting function $\pi(x)$. Knowing fine information about one gives us fine information about the other, they're practically interchangable. For instance, if $\pi(x)~x/\log(x)$ then $\psi(x)~x$. The terms on the right are what are insteresting. The $x-b$ comes directly from the pole via the term  $\frac{e^{a+bs}}{s-1}$, and it is the term that grows the fastest out of all of them, so it dominates the growth of $\psi(x)$ and therefore the primes. Since this term grows unboundedly, we can see how the pole influences the fact that there are infinitely many primes and things like that. The logarithmic term comes from the trivial zeros, and it goes to zero at infinity, so it is not really important at all. Some may even say that it's trivial.
    </p>
      <p>The final term is what we get from the nontrivial zeros with $0\leq Re(\rho)\leq 1$. How this term behaves will affect how the slightly more fine details about the distribution of primes. Since these have complex numbers in the exponents, each of these terms will oscillate as $x$ grows. How much they oscillate depends on where the zeros are. If there are zeros with $Re(s)=1$, then dividing through by $x$ and ignoring the terms that go to zero gives us
        $$
        \psi(x)/x = 1 - \sum_{Re(\rho)=1}\frac{x^{\rho-1}}{\rho}
        $$
        The other nontrivial zeros will get killed when $x\rightarrow \infty$. So the growth rate of $\psi(x)$ depends on the location of these zeros. If there are no such zeros, then we'll have $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\psi(x)/x=1$, which is not necessarily the case if there are zeros like this. The Prime Number Theorem then asserts that there are no such zeros, and so we get the asymptotic result $\psi(x)~x$ which means that $\pi(x)~x/\log(x)$, which is much stronger than we already showed. This shows that, asymptotically, the only contribution to the prime distribution that really matters is the one coming from the pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determining how much we can ignore the nontrivial zero term is the question of the Riemann Hypothesis. It states that the nontrivial zeros contribute as little as possible to this expression and tells us a bit about the remainder term of $\psi(x)-x$. It says that $\psi(x)=x+o(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$. 
      
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    Overall, the pole of the Riemann Zeta Function tells us about the dominant trends in the distribution of primes. In fact, not mentioned was how the behaviour of primes in arithmetic progressions also depend on this pole. The nontrivial zeros tell us about the finer details of this distribution.
