  I think that entire courses could be designed around using conics to explore a wide variety of ideas. Conic sections are simple enough so that explicit computations, diagrams, proofs can be done with minimal effort, but complex enough to exhibit interesting behavior. Many discussions about conics can be dry. There's a lot you can do, and the proofs are relatively direct, and so you mostly end up with blocks of proofs with little context. This is a disservice to conics and I want to mend some of this damage.

    What a conic is depends on how you think about it. I'm an algebraist at heart, so I mainly think of them as graphs to certain equations. Through this lens the most general definition is as the set of points satisfying the equation
    </p>
    $ ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 +dx + ey + f = 0$
    <p>
     There are some caveats to this. Firstly, not all the quadratic coefficients can be zero, otherwise you just have a line and we don't want lines to be conics. Similarly, we don't want double lines to be conics either and equations like $(x-y)(x+y)$ is technically of this form, but the graph is a giant X through the origin. Double lines are just two lines combined together and this manifests in equations as a product of linear terms:
    </p>
    $(px+qy+m)(rx+sy+n)=0$
    <p>
       This creates a pair of lines through the zero product property; if their product is zero then at least one of the terms is zero and so we get a pair of lines through each term. This is already hitting at something deep in the relationships between geometry and algebra. A graph of an algebraic equation is a combination of simpler graphs exactly when the original equation can be factored, where each factor corresponds to a smaller component of the graph. It is only when an equation is not factorizable that its graph produces an irreducible geometric object. Another context where factorizability is important is when we deal with integers, where primes are the irreducible arithmetic objects. What we then have is a geometric realization of "prime" algebraic equations. A "prime" algebraic equation is one that is not the composition of simpler equations. This connection is at the center of thinking behind Algebraic Geometry. Prime arithmetic objects correspond to geometrically irreducible ones. This way of thinking allows us to blur the lines between these two types of objects and treat one as we would the other. Algebraic Geometry uses this analogy to turn geometric objects into arithmetic ones, and to turn arithmetic objects into geometric ones. For instance, to study arithmetic we turn the set of integers into an explicit geometric space called the Spectrum of the Integers. This conversion exposes properties of arithmetic by allowing the integers to relate to more objects through this spectrum. If we have more relations, then we have more information, then we can prove more theorems. So even through the very definition of what a conic is, we can get into some deep thinking about the relationships between arithmetic and geometry.

      If a bivariate quadratic equation is not reducible, is prime, then we call it a conic.
