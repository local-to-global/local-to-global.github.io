  An issue that is likely to only become more mainstream are issues of the rights of transgender people. While discussions on trans-rights has always existed, even sometimes getting mainstream coverage, it has generally been a passing topic. The typical transphobic stances, usually expressed by old white men, can just seem like a tiresome extension, or last-gasp, of homophobia. The transphobic movement, however, has been revitalized by white women and under the banner of feminism. These trans-exclusionary radical feminists, or TERFs for short, use language adopted from old-school feminism to recast old transphobic narratives as being a way to empower women. TERFs have existed for a long time, and often under the name of "Gender Critical" or "Gender Realists", but have gotten attention and a more mainstream boost through the previously beloved author JK Rowling. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For some time, people noticed JK Rowling following and liking Twitter posts expressing TERF views and so people suspected she main share such views. This was backhandedly confirmed when <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/06/j-k-rowling-explains-thinks-trans-women-arent-real-women-3700-word-rambling-essay/">Rowling wrote a very long TERF manifesto</a>, and since she has been very <a href = "https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/09/j-k-rowling-plugs-disgusting-anti-trans-online-store-14-million-twitter-followers/">open about supporting TERFs and giving them a platform to be heard</a>. This disappointed many of her LGBT+ fans, and has <a href = "https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/09/celebrities-authors-picking-sides-j-k-rowlings-war-trans-people/">created a rift</a> between many important and well-known authors and British celebraties. Many, including <a href = "https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/10/neil-gaiman-stephen-king-come-swinging-forceful-pushback-j-k-rowlings-transphobia/>Steven King, Neil Gaiman, Margaret Atwood</a> and the <a href = "https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/06/harry-potter-actors-lining-denounce-j-k-rowlings-attacks-transgender-people/">three stars of the Harry Potter films</a> have, since, expressed explicit support for trans-people and trans-rights, in opposition of Rowling. Others, on the other hand, including <a href = "https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/10/john-cleese-says-hes-proud-support-j-k-rowling-hatred/">John Cleese</a> and <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/09/hagrid-comes-j-k-rowlings-defense-trans-people-waiting-offended/">Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid)</a>, have expressed support. While this seems to be a phenomena centered mostly around UK celebrity culture, the more widespread support of trans-people by American figures could mean that we might see trans-rights issues become a much more mainstream topic.

  I should say one important thing about this: While the issue of trans-rights is getting more coverage, the people who are talking are mostly cis-people. The voices of trans-people are still being left out of a conversation central to their well-being. I, myself, am no a trans-person. Only trans-people know of the trans lived experience and they should serve as primary sources for this discussion. Here are a few places/sources which give them voice:

  </ul>
  In general, it is better to learn about what it means to be transgender from transgender people by taking what they say seriously, rather than JK Rowling. Or me.

    One thing to note about TERFs is that, though not exclusively, they tend to be older than the trans-allies. Even within the Harry Potter celebrities, Rowling, Cleese, and Coltrane have expressed support of TERFs, while the three young stars have supported tran people. This is reflective of another difference of eras, namely that TERF ideology is steeped in the language of old-school feminism and is even supported by older feminists. It is instructive to try to understand what this means and why mainstream academic feminism has long-since moved away from this kind of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our theories and philosophies reflect the times in which they are made. The first main movement we generally think of as "feminist" is likely the Women's Suffrage movement. This was when women fought for their right to vote and own land. Much of the focus was on accessing public institutions as women and getting rid of many of the overt legsilative exclusions. This movement was, at times, very racist and generally only for the benefit of wealthy white women. It, furthermore, nudged the door open and did nothing to address systemic societal issues of sexism.
    </p>
    <p>
    While first-wave feminism allowed for some basic legal rights for woemn, it did not allow women them the same rights and freedoms of men. When it came to women empowerment over the workplace, family, sex, and protection from sexaul abuse, more work was needed. This ushered in a way of thinking about feminist issues, and much of it focused on the female body. This makes sense when the main topics of concern include sexual reproduction rights and standings in the workplace. When it was argued that certain jobs simply couldn't be done by women, women turned to using their bodies as sources of power and empowerment to disrupt that thinking. While not at all universal to this era, many feminists of this time stress the vagian and lesbianism as being central to the essence of being a woman. These feminists were very productive in providing social and political automoy and freedom to many women, freeing them from sexist workplace norms, abusive marriages from which they could not leave, and greater sexual health. 
    </p>
    <p>
    But the longer that many of these philosophies existed, the more difficult it came to maintain them. Second-wave feminism still suffered from a race problem, and in the 70s and 80s many black feminists started to make noise about this. Often, binding womanhood to the female body meant binding it to the white female body, resulting in the exclusion of the lived experiences of many women. The experiences of women from different cultures and backgrounds were often not represented in the politics of white academic feminism. And so the issue was that feminists tended to universalize the experiences of white women and codify these experiences within the female body itself which essentialized and naturalized their perspectives. The excluded perspectives began to pile up. Not just women of color in the US and EU, but the experiences of women in totally different cultures, and women who did not fall into nice biological categories, such as intersex women and transwomen. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Eventually it became clear that the project of tying gender to the body was impossible. The social contingency of the many aspects of gender, along with the scientific breakdown of distinct biological categories of sex all meant that they were trying to fit square pegs into round holes, neither of which even existed in the first place! The issue is that whenever you try to essentialize gender, what you end up doing is falsely making real one particular perspective of gender and all its political baggage. An essentialist argument from any kind of "human nature" ends up being the point where an argument breaksdown. And so for feminism to take political action, it would have to do so from a wholly non-essentialist perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
    Today, then, contemporary feminism tends to avoid arguments which universalize, essentialize, or naturalize aspects of gender. There is a greater emphasis on discourse, lived-experiences, and seeking out different ways of knowing. This allows for more voices to be heard, voices which had previously been hidden by universal assumptions about gender. This also makes the feminist project more flexible and adaptive, since it isnt' a one-size-fits-all mindset, which gives it more practical and effective power (despite the theory being very abstract at times). 
    </p>
    <p>
    This move away from gender essentialism was both practical and morally necessary. It prevents one class of people from imposing what legitimate femininity is onto everyone, and seeks to appreciate the diversity of womanhood. It prevents womanhood from taking a patriarchial role, as feminism should seek to dismantle patriarchy rather than re-brand patriarchy. It also recognizes the emptiness of arguments based in some "core truth" about humanity. It also runs counter to how we're taught to think about things while living in a state of modernity. TERF ideology is an ideology based in gender essentialism, and so these notes are important to keep in mind, because these they manifest within TERF thinking. TERF thinking is, then, a really good case example of why we should avoid universalizing and essentialist thinking.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
    TERF thinking, while not an iconoclastic institution, is based in essential differences between men and women, which results in a skepticism and fear of men. Men are defined by their penis and sexually driven, more physically powerful and prone to violence, while being a woman is fundamentally based on having a vagina and being able to bear children. From this perspective, any person who demonstrates some kind of gender or sexual non-conformity is either broken or perverted. 
    </p>
    <p>
    These statements are, generally, not justified. Vague appeals to science as demonstrating there are boys and girls and that's that never acknowledge the fluidity that anatomy and biology show us, or that science played an important role in questioning these simple categories (a project which Harvard's <a href = "https://www.genderscilab.org/blog"> GenderSci Lab</a> investigates). In general, to make these appeals you must ignore 40 years of feminism and even more of science and so they end up being totally baseless. This appeal is codified for them in their prefered name "Gender Critical", where they take on the mantle of being skeptical of more developed philosophy around gender and where Rowling makes "radical" claims such as "sex is real". But this type of skepticism is more reflective of an ignorance of science and is more akin to the skepticism that Flat Earthers use. In fact, both say it's "simple science" and explicitly reject mainstream science and philosophy as being too complicated (especially when you can just look at a horizon and see it's flat! or look at people's junk and see penises and vaginas!)
    </p>
    <p>
    Baseless as these claims are, because we don't have any gender, feminist, or LGBTQ+ eduction they can seem obvious or "common sense" to many people and so they have impacts in how our politics and how we view others. The main battleground for this are women's restrooms and other women's spaces. If gender is inextricably tied to genitles, then a transwoman is, at best, a man in a costume who may have engaged in "body mutilation". This is an invasion of such spaces by (to them) a man and since men are more prone to violence and perversion, such an invasion is a threat to the "real" women. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Many of these women are victims of domestic or sexual abuse and so their experiences and fears should not be discredited. But we can see how, within this, the processes of universalization and naturalization, which feminism has rejected, in practice. Properties and qualities of men who have legitimately acted in violent ways are, through the penis itself, transfered onto others who are, themselves, generally outcast.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now, the story that many TERFs will give you is that they are not necessarily afraid of the transwoman using the bathroom, but rather what that implies. If they have to let the transwoman into the women's restroom, then there is nothing to stop a perverted and pernicious man from dressing up like a woman and entering the woman's restroom and assaulting or creeping on the women.
