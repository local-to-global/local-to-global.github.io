  In math, one of the major themes over the past hundred or more years has been the relationships between local problems and global problems. Local problems are ones which exist within some kind of limited horizon, usually very zoomed in so that the setting in which we're working in is very small and very simple. Global problems are the opposite; problems which live on a very zoomed out space and must incorporate large-scale and very complicated structure. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Each type of problem has its advantages: Local problems are easier, and global problems give us a lot of information. But there are related drawbacks: Local problems have limited information, and global problems are much, much harder. The general idea in math is to take a global problem and break it up into smaller local pieces, solve each of these local bits separately, and then try to glue all of these solutions together to create a solution to the global problem. 
  </p>

  The hard part about this is gluing together all the local solutions. You might think you have it solved everywhere, but when you put all of the pieces together you can end up with something unwieldly or impossible. An visual example of this would be the Penrose Tribar pictured above. This object makes sense locally, it's only when we put it together all as a whole that it becomes impossible. Almost every field in math has their own tools and strategies for this local-to-global process of trying to glue solutions together, but there is still a lot we cannot do. And so mathematics often lives in a space that is not-quite-local and not-quite-global. It is a place where connections between local solutions are traced and stretched out across a global body. It's a space of making connections, stitching together local ideas, and figuring out how to work with obstructions and contradictions which arise. It is this intersticial place which defies clear definition where progress is made and mathematical understanding is constructed.

  I see local-to-global thinking not just in math, but everywhere I look.
  </p>
  <p>
  We live in a time where there are many interconnected global problems - Climate Change, Racism, Economic Inequality, Sexism, War, Poverty, Food and Water scarcity, Patriarchy, etc -  and lots of people want to try to solve these problems. But just like interesting math problems, working on them globally is untenable; they are way to complicated to even concieve of on a global scale, let alone find a solution. And so, whether we are aware or not, we end up minimizing the scope of the problem until it becomes a local problem. This could be in region, for instance we could end qualified immunity in New York to address the problem of NYPD police brutality. This is clearly addressing the problem of racism in a local region. But the localization process could be a process of filtering out various factors of the problem, and still encompass the whole Earth. For instance, keeping track of average CO2 concentration is a whole-Earth project but filters out infinitely many factors relevant to climate change.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is all well and good, qualified immunity does need to be abolished in specific regions, and we need to keep track of the CO2 concentration in the air. After all, the strategy is to FIRST solve the local problems, and then construct a global solution from them. The issue comes when we forget that we zoomed in, or how far we zoomed in. We then end up mistaking a solution to a local problem as actually being THE solution to a global problem.
  </p>
  <p>
  If we just think of climate change in terms of global CO2 concentrations, for example, and seek to solve nothing but that, then we ignore issues of Climate and Environmental Justice that indigenous people and countries in the Global South are voicing as they actively face the current (and future) impacts of climate change. Moreover, our solutions could end up not doing the job and directly harming these people, making the global situation worse. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Just as much of math occupies a place which is neither local or global, but some ill-defined place in-between - weaving together local ideas - so to do we need to occupy an ill-defined place between the local and the global when it comes to the major and existential problems. Every nation on the Earth can agree to the Paris Agreement, but if we're not weaving strategies together to make a cohesive solution, we'll find that countries which lower their emissions are actually exporting them elsewhere making no real impact on global CO2. 
  </p>

  This idea is expounded upon through the work of philosopher and anthropolgist Bruno Latour (in math, many local-to-global ideas are also done by the French; an interesting coincidence). In his view, the trajectory that we like to imagine society is on, one of modernizing progress towards global/universal knowledge, the globalists have forgotten that they had to localize the world in order to make sense of it. The world that this kind of technological "progress" creates is twisted, ignoring much of "reality". He then sees the rise of Trump and other authoritarians as a reaction to this, which pushes for a purely local-based thinking. Not only to closed-borders and nationalism literally exclude much of the world, but even truth and rhetoric matter on very short time-scales and the people who are "valid" are smaller. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For Latour, the way to progress is to get off of this local-or-global binary, and to seek to occupy a space where we can trace connections, subjectivities, and interactions then figure out ways to manage obstructions and contradictions which arise in this context. In other words, he wants us to occupy the space that mathematicians have found themselves in. Feminist philosophy Donna Haraway makes similar proclimations, tracing out "string figures" between things as a way to make choices, not to fix everything but as a way to "stay with the trouble". It's this ill-defined place that allows us to be reactive and understand the relationships between many different local things, and it is this place that we need to be.

  What does this mean?
  </p>
  <p>
  Firstly, solutions to these problems which necessarily rely on some kind of localization should be abandoned. Many people want to act on climate change through the commodification of nature and the atmosphere. But commodification is necessarily a localizing process, as you reduce entire ecosystems to their market value and ignore their broad tendrils which connect them with other things. Market solutions are then ways for corporations to sideline any real responsibility for climate change through localizing process. If something like a carbon tax is needed for additional leverage, then it could play a small local piece, but it must always be situated with its connections to other things so that we don't over-localize on it.
  </p>
  <p>
  Secondly, we need to be wary of ideas which obscure the global. Many ideologies wish to isolate people, because it prevents connections from being made and stop ideas which challenge the status quo from spreading. We need to break through this mist by finding those who have been hidden from us. We need to keep taps on those who are excluded from our locality. Listening and giving voice to the voiceless is a radical tool to do this. Not just for people who have been excluded, but for other things revealed to use through mechanisms like science. Giving voice to a bird by understanding their ways throush science can be a powerful way to make a stand against those who wish to make our world small in order to dominate it.
    </p>
  <p>
  Third, we need to move beyond ideas which prevent the kinds of interconnections we need from forming. In a way, this means avoiding universal claims of truth because these function to prevent lines from being drawn and connections from being made. If you are a Richard Dawkins-esque anti-theist, then meaningful cooporation with Christians or Muslims is out of the question and so a wall is formed where there needs to be a path. The Trump-supporting American is in that position because of some kind of frustration with how things are, understanding why that might be the case is a positive way to build some kind of non-local connection which can be leveraged to address important issues.
