 Speedrunning is the challenge of completing a game, within certain preset constraints, as fast as possible. Speedrunning is a mix of luck, persistence, and skill. A speedrunner can do everything totally correct, but still fail a run simply because certain random elements have not aligned properly to allow them to succeed. And so the goal of a speedrunner is to become as consistent with the skills in the game as they possibly can so that when things do line up, they are able to take advantage of it and get a world record run. This means, in particular, that great persistence and endurance is needed as the chances of everything lining up can be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myiQoshe8M8">one-in-many-thousands opportunity</a>. You have to be consistent and ready when the stars finally align.
 </p>
 <p>
 So, in general, if someone submits a run to be a potential world record, we can expect it to have some insane luck. But, at the same time, we can expect this run to be the one run of potentially thousands of runs which "allowed" this luck to manifest. Overall, we'd expect their average run to be very typical as its all about being in the right place at the right time to get a world record.
 </p>
 <p>
 Within this context, we have some drama in the Minecraft speedrunning community, and it can help us see what it means to defer to experts. This can be seen as a much less serious instance of climate change denial, COVID-19 denial, anti-vaccination movement, and just "Fake News" in general. It prompts the quesion: "When is an expert legitimate enough and how do we know when to defer to experts?"
 </p>

 <p>
 The controversy revolves around the Minecraft speedrunner named Dream. Overall he is a skilled player and, thanks to the pandemic, has seen some huge growth in popularity - mostly with very young people. He submitted a run to <a href="https://speedrun.com">speedrun.com</a>, a site which validates runs and tracks speedrunning records in a centralized and trusted place, for world record validation. The run itself had some incredible luck, but this is to be expected as all successful speedruns will have outcomes with low probability simply. The issue is that viewers of his stream noted that the luck in his world record was not that much more lucky than his average run. That is, his average run was obscenely lucky, which would very drastically increase the likelihood of planets aligning for a world record run. So, while we can expect a world record run to have lucky things happen, we should not expect an average run to demonstrate such luck.
 </p>
 <p>
 This made the moderators at speedrun.com raise their eyebrows a bit, and prompted them to look a bit deeper into Dream's runs. They examined his many on-stream attempts to see just how lucky he had been, and whether or not it was reasonable. Through some statistical analysis, they found that the chances of Dream's luck occuring were 1 in 7.5 trillion. These are the chances Dream's luck occuring for <i>any</i> speedrunner. That is, if we look at all the speedrunners who are running this game, then these is a 1 in 7.5 trillion chance that we see luck like Dream's occuring for even one of them. These numbers come from a <a href = "https://mcspeedrun.com/dream.pdf">statistical analysis</a> which biases in favor of Dream as much as possible (it is explained for a wide audience <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MYw9LcLCb4">here</a>). 
 </p>
 <p>
 It is much more likely that Dream modified the game code to increase his chances (it is actually quite simple to do undetected as explained <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/kbv9qd/he_just_got_lucky_guys/gfldz4y/">here</a>) than these chances occuring. The mods, therefore, used this analysis to conclude that Dream cheated and did not validate his world record. While Dream did do the run skillfully and successfully, he skipped over one of the core components of speedrunning: Persistence. He felt that he had the skill needed for a world record run, and it was only the luck needed which was holding him back, and so modifying the luck in the game allowed him to realize his potential.
 </p>

 <p>
 Case closed, right? Not quite.
 </p>
 <p>
 Dream and his fans denied the results. He "just got lucky" became the defense - and not a very good one. And while the paper that the mods of speedrun.com produced did recieve some criticism and scrutiney from <a href = "https://old.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/kbteyd/d_minecraft_speedrunner_caught_cheating_by_using/">fans of statistics</a> (a little bit because it wasn't an academic quality paper, even though non-experts were impressed by it). But, overall, the criticisms were slight corrections, nitpicks, and use of language, and they were in general concensus with the conclusion of the mod team's work. So it was up to Dream to respond and take responsibility for his actions.
 </p>
 <p>
 This is where I want to begin to interrogate the notion of appealing to experts. Most people, especially Dream's typically young aurdience, do not understand the statistical analysis of the mod team's paper. So even if it is legitimate as a tool for arguing that Dream cheated, as a rhetorical device it is much less convincing to the people that most need convincing. All that they see is a fancy looking document, with ineligable words, which is weilded as a weapon to discredit Dream. The actual argument they present is moot, and what they see is the pagentry of a "Academic, LaTeX Document" as the focus. Moreover, the mod team claimed to have mathematical experts backing their results, and the people backing the results on the statistics subreddit also claimed to be experts as well (specifically a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamWasTaken/comments/kbs5e1/speedrun_removal_dream/gflj769/">confirmed PhD in particle physics</a> who got banned from Dream's subreddit).
 </p>
 <p>
 So, really, all that Dream needs to do to clear is name is find an impressive sounding "Expert" who can write an impressive looking "Academic Document" supporting him. It is not the content, but the pagentry, and doing this will give Dream the ability to claim to be at least as valid as the mod team. 
 </p>
 <p>
 And that's exactly what he did. Dream contacted a <a href="https://www.photoexcitation.com/">company</a> which, allegedly, hires real academics to do review work of things like proposals, papers, and other documents. The academics hired by this company are totally and completely anonymous, and so we have to take the word of the company that they are legitimate. Through this company, Dream allegedly hires a PhD astrophysicist from Harvard to do this pageantry for him. This alleged astrophysicist then produces a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yfLURFdDhMfrvI2cFMdYM8f_M_IRoAlM/view">counter-paper for Dream</a>. And, like the mod team did, Dream made his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iqpSrNVjYQ">own video explaining the content of the paper</a>. Though, unlike the mod team, Dream doesn't really try to explain what is in the paper, but tries to give excuses for his luck
 </p>
 <p>
 The critical reception of Dream's paper was quite negative. Much of it can be summarized by the aforementioned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/kiqosv/d_accused_minecraft_speedrunner_who_was_caught/ggse2er/">particle physicist</a>. But, overall, the content of the comissioned paper was not impressive and certainly not enough to exonerate Dream. For instance, the comissioned paper brings the 1 in 7.5 trillion number down to 1 in 100 million, which is still low enough for the mod team's conclusions.
 </p>
 <p>
 But, it's not about the arguments, it's about the pageantry. To the layperson, what we have are two experts who say different things and so there's no reason to listen to the other side. We've gotten to a rhetorical stalemate, which is a situation favoring Dream. Some people in the speedrunning community are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/kknr4p/why_i_interviewed_dream_responding_to_rspeedrun/">upset</a> about some people buying into Dream's pageantry.
 </p>
 <hr>
 <p>
 While it is important to listen to both sides of an argument and be openminded about what people are saying, we still need to be able to make judgements in meaningful ways - even when the specifics of the arguments go over our heads and require a certain level of expertise. We can't let the pageantry of expertise put us in a stalemate. While, in this case, the judgement is quite unimportant, it mimics a tendency for us to draw stalemates on important issues in the scientific and political stage - issues which are resolved within these areas of expertise. Tobacco companies can continue to kill people, as long as they make it an expert vs expert stalemate. Oil companies can continue to produce climate change, as long as it is an expert vs expert stalemate. People can deny the severity of COVID-19 as long as it is an expert vs expert stalemate. People can ignore systemic racism, as long as it is an expert vs expert stalemate. Seeking the middle ground between "both sides" allows the ones who are illegitimate to continue weilding power.
 </p>
 <p>
 And so the question becomes: As laypeople, how can we know which experts we need to listen to and appeal to in such stalemates?
 </p>
 <p>
 The way that illegitimate sides gain legitimacy in situations like this is the pageantry of expertise. As long as they look like an expert, and mimic - to the public eye - the work of experts, then they can claim to have equal footing as the experts. We see this with Dream, and we see this with Climate Change deniers. This pageantry is focused on the specific individuals involved as specific people who have the title "expert". It then becomes a battle between two individuals who, to the public eye, have the same "power" to make conclusions.
 </p>
 <p>
 But expertise is not a quality of an individual. Expertise exists within a social context of review and validation. A scientist is legitimate because they exist within a robust social setting, in which many people work together as a community to create an understanding of the physical world. The words of a scientist, while having their own personal flair, are the words of the entire scientific community which, together, created the knowledge behind the words. Appealing to the expertise of a scientist is then appealing to the social institution of science - which was created specifically to produce robust and experimentally verifiable conclusions. The counter-expert typically does not have such a context. They usually are just an individual hired by some person or firm to use the title of "expert" to legitimize certain ideas. They do not have a robust community supporting them, at most its them and other dissidents - often all supported financially by vested interests. These firms then shop around for legitimacy by buying out experts. But they cannot buy out the entire scientific community, and so they have to focus on the pageantry of expertise. In this way, the focus on pageantry dissolves relevant communities, leaving only two individuals and a stalemate.
 </p>
 <p>
 So it is important to place experts in the context which validates their expertise, and it is this context which we appeal to - not the individual experts. Oil companies know this, as they do try to sow public distrust in the scientific institutions.
