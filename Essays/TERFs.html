  Intro - JK
  
  <p>
  An issue that is likely to only become more mainstream are issues of the rights of transgender people. While discussions on trans-rights has always existed, even sometimes getting mainstream coverage, it has generally been a passing topic. The typical transphobic stances, usually expressed by old white men, can just seem like a tiresome extension, or last-gasp, of homophobia. The transphobic movement, however, has been revitalized by white women and under the banner of feminism. These trans-exclusionary radical feminists, or TERFs for short, use language adopted from old-school feminism to recast old transphobic narratives as being a way to empower women. TERFs have existed for a long time, and often under the name of "Gender Critical" or "Gender Realists", but have gotten attention and a more mainstream boost through the previously beloved author JK Rowling. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For some time, people noticed JK Rowling following and liking Twitter posts expressing TERF views and so people suspected she main share such views. This was backhandedly confirmed when Rowling wrote a very long TERF manifesto, and since she has been very open about supporting TERFs and giving them a platform to be heard. This disappointed many of her LGBT+ fans, and has created a rift between many important and well-known authors and British celebraties. Many, including Steven King, Neil Gaiman, Margaret Atwood and the three stars of the Harry Potter films have, since, expressed explicit support for trans-people and trans-rights, in opposition of Rowling. Others, on the other hand, including John Cleese and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), have expressed support. While this seems to be a phenomena centered mostly around UK celebrity culture, the more widespread support of trans-people by American figures could mean that we might see trans-rights issues become a much more mainstream topic.

  I should say one important thing about this: While the issue of trans-rights is getting more coverage, the people who are talking are mostly cis-people. The voices of trans-people are still being left out of a conversation central to their well-being. I, myself, am no a trans-person. Only trans-people know of the trans lived experience and they should serve as primary sources for this discussion. Here are a few places/sources which give them voice:

  </ul>
  In general, it is better to learn about what it means to be transgender from transgender people by taking what they say seriously, rather than JK Rowling. Or me.
