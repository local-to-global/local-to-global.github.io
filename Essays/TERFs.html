  JK Rowling has recently become a figurehead for a transphobic sect of feminist thinking commonly referred to as TERFs, or Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism. This movement takes transphobic ideas and recasts them through a suitable feminist lens as a way to revitalize them to seemingly give it more legitimacy. While transphobes are not a unified institution, they generally share a core conviction to the idea that gender is inextricably tied to biological sex. A "female body" is necessary for womanhood, and a "male body" necessarily comes with certain masculine traits. 
  </p>
  <p>
  An important thing to note is that mainstream academic feminism has long abandoned this kind of thinking and generally avoids arguments based upon universalization, naturalization, and essentializing arguments. This is because when you do try to do this, what happens is that you reify, or "make real", one particular perspective. When doing this with gender, grounding onto a sexed body, you end up reifying the political assumptions embedded within your perspective. This is problematic as it excludes certain women's perspecties from being legitimate and the policies which they inform end up hurting the excluded people. In a way, universalization can take feminist perspectives and patriarchify them into ways of re-instancing patriarchal means of control. 
  </p>
  <p>
  It took a long time for feminists to really understand these mechanisms, and we generally see argument deriving womanhood from the body, through the vagina or even lesbianism, in older feminist writing which, while important for their times (to fight for things like sexual autonomy), are now out-dated. TERFs, however, have taken the language of these body-essentialist feminist writing and re-appropriated them as a tool for transphobia. Through this lens, a "woman's space" is a space for people who were born with vaginas and anyone born with a penis in these spaces is necessarily being invasive. If a transperson wants to surgically transition, then they are taking the thing that is essential to their "true" gender and "mutilating" it. And so it is abusive to "subject" trans-teenagers to gender-affirming treatment, which ignores that this can be a treatment for mental health issues, usually brought on by telling them they're not legitimate in their gender. Since a person with a penis is a man, a lesbianism is erased when a woman dates a trans-woman and so trans-allies are recast as homophobes in their eyes (despite the majority of the LGBTQ+ community being very pro-trans).
  </p>
  <p> 
  Under this naturalization, there are only three kinds of people: Men, Women, and Broken. And so transpeople are not to be treated as the gender through which they exist, but as broken people. Transwomen are broken by being perverts or hidden homosexuals or some other condition based within toxic masculinity. Transmen are lost lesbian souls. And intersex people are disordered. Their existence does not challenge TERFs to rethink the relationship between gender and the body, but to fix them. Trans-conversion therapy is not an uncommon solution put forth by them, and intersex kids must be surgically "fixed". 
  </p>
  <p>
  Because LGBTQ+ advocates generally, at some level, disrupt this link between body and gender and so is seen as the dominant view (despite it not being so anywhere else), TERFs view themselves being skeptical of this thinking and seek to brand themselves as "Gender Critical" and taking the "radical" stance that biological sex exists. But this is simply a way to appeal to common sense as a way to reify the politics onto gendered bodies. <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/">Science</a> and feminism have both, independently and <a href = "https://www.genderscilab.org/">together</a>, already demonstrated how misguided our common sense is about gender and how allowing it to be dynamic is beneficial for all. This rejection of science while appealing to science as "common sense" mimics the rhetoric of Flat Earhters, who point to a flat horizon as common sense science to why the Earth is not round. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Under this brand of being "gender critical" is also the rhetoric of seeking debate. They're "just questioning" ideas of gender and "being skeptical". Not only does this ignore the 50 years of science, feminism, and philosophy which included debate and produced these more fluid ideas of gender, the table of debate is a place where they have already won. If we accept the debate table as legitimate, then we are saying that, until the debate has concluded, that certain men/women/NBs do not exist. The table is very lopsided, as one side has no stakes, whereas the other side's whole existence is on the line. Furthermore, this is a table where the debate will never end, the "skeptics" will never be satisfied and always ask "why?", which means that transpeople will never exist. Ciswomen have never had to go to the debate table to prove their womanhood, so why should transwomen? (See more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCxqdhZkxCo">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdvM_pRfuFM">here</a>.)
  </p>
    <p>
      Because of this it is not helpful to engage on their terms, by taking their arguments. You can show that the reason that trans people are more suicidally prone is because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/">they live in situations where they have to constantly prove their gender and are unsupported by others</a> or <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00918369.2016.1157998">are forced to use the wrong restroom</a> or point to the science of biology and gender and how it does not support them all day, but it won't matter because they won when the debate was legitimized. This is different from a person seeking to understand how gender can be more complex than penis/vagina since this is asked from a place of seeking to grow, rather than a place of debate. While TERF ideas might be outdated and illegitimate, it is important not to deligitimate the people involved. Many are legitimate victims of sexual abuse by men and are seeking safety, and the TERF stories soking (illegitimate) fears of transwomen opening the doors for abusers and perverts can resonate with them. These fears are backed by toxic views of masculinity and so more positive discourse about men, and better women's health services/shelters can be ways of engaging with these fears and treating them without legitimating a TERF worldview.
    </p>
  <p>
  In the end, TERF is an instance of <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/09/living-in-the-time-of-gender-revelations?fbclid=IwAR24WaEvJcOo78j8CihUmVkNyfN934U2YzKmtw_7O11VfCfJdcSDCyEiq78">backlash</a> against the heteronormative patriarchal notions. Asking things like "has feminism gone too far?!". TERFs are, generally (not exclusively), generational and find allies with people who would never legitimate a feminist thought. The more fluid notions of gender go against their common sense notion which were taught to them by patriarchal powers. TERFs, then, are a way that the patriarchy uses feminist language and women who have legitimately been hurt by abusive men as ways to re-entrench its norms and power, and it embodies all the reasons why mainstream academic feminism abandoned naturalizing modes of reasoning.
