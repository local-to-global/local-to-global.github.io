    Cogito, ergo sum - Descarte

  <p>
  Individualism is an ideology which centralizes the isolated person as the main object of governance. It has been a dominant part of all Western thought since the enlightenment and informed our political systems, our economic systems, how we relate to the world, and shaped our ideas about human nature itself. It has been used to overthrow tyrants as well as to justify genocide. But, importantly, it is fundamental to how we view ourselves as a civilization and our relationship to others.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most succinct, and cliche, summation of individualism can be found in Descarte's famous line "I think, therefore I am". This line was written in Descarte's quest to find out what he could actually, truly "know" without any room for doubt or skepticism. Since we can't trust our senses, which can be manipulated or our body, then there is ground to doubt the world itself. But since it is you who are asking this question and seeking an answer, and you cannot experience thought without existing in the firstplace, really the only thing that we can know for sure to exist is ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is not just a fun philosophical inquiry. This identification of the isolated self as the only truly intelligible thing makes this the starting place for decisions, policymaking, and political ideology. For monarchs who wield power through divine right, whose starting place is God, the shift to the individual is politically threatening. It is in this time that we see political ideas shift from the divine right to social contract theory. Thomas Hobbes very critically argued in his book <i>Leviathan</i> for a political institution rule by a monarch who obtained his power/authority not from God but by his individual subjects ceding power to him. Importantly, his argument uses the self-isolated individual as the starting point, and he justifies unequal monarchal hierarchies through ideologies which profess treating everyone as equal (but separate) individuals.
  </p>
  <p>
  Within his argument, Hobbes uses an idea which is inseparable from individualism: The idea that individuals act through self-interest. If the isolated self is our starting point, then we need to know what motivates the self to act within an isolated universe. And since there is nothing except the self, then things which motivate the self to act are the things which benefit the self. In other words, the self will act selfishly. And so it is through the ideology of the individual that these wealthy Europeans saw themselves reflected in what they interpreted as human nature: It was not a flaw on their part to be selfish, it was, in fact, pure human nature. They also transcribed their own selfishness and power-hunger onto the entire human race as something inseparably human. And since it was a matter-of-fact that humans were selfish, we should employ political systems which understand this as basic fact. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Under these assumptions, it is very easy to argue for systems where hierarchies not only exist, but are features. Give a reward - power - for being the best and humans - who are selfish and want power - will do what they can to get it. It's only a question about ensuring that the system will only reward those most capible. For the selfish people already in power, justifying the systems which placed them there, this was very convenient. And so the ideology of individualism quickly turned from a way to challenge the hierarchal power of the monarchs, into justifying them.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>
  Hobbes invoked the idea of the State of Nature to make his arguments. For him, humans before any kind of civilization lived in a "State of Nature" and, because everyone is selfishly motivated, it was a place of war with ever human pitted against every other. Forming some kind of political authority was a way to avoid the trials of war. John Locke, who was hugely influencial on the founders of the US, saw the State of Nature differently. He saw it as a place where everyone had perfect freedom and liberty, where the laws of nature (which also contain moral substance - so you can't just kill someone) are the only limitations placed on a self. In a state of nature, humans are free to persue self-interest. Humans then leave the state of nature when they begin to work the land, giving them a right to private property through their labor. The then form governments as a way to protect their private property and it is through this that a government gains legitimacy. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The self-interested individual, again, serves to protect those with power. The only legitimate subjects are, then, private land owners who should have the ability to individual freedom and self-determination. Other people do not matter. Particularly, indigenous claims to land are illigitimate since they do not occupy it in a way that Europeans recognized, and it became a moral duty based on human nature to take, occupy, and work their land. Convenient for people who already took, occupied, and worked that land. African slaves and indigenous people were then not simply excluded from the "We the people..." part of the constitution because of backwards racism, the backwards racism was created as part of an ideology which weilded individualism to justify the hierarchies which necessarily excluded them.
  </p>
  <p>
  In systems founded on individualism, it is only the individuals who can become heard that get to determine the rules to the games. Since it takes power to become heared, the resulting systems function to re-institute and deepen inequalities. It then becomes a radical act for someone to gain voice. Once new people gain voice, they can often wield individualism against their oppressors. However, this results in oppressors feeling like their individualism is threatened and they produce a backlash, asking is egalitarian acts have "gone too far?", which act to limit - or even reverse - gains made. 
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>
  So far, the features that the ideologies of individualism have are that they reify selfishness, and so political systems favor the greedy, and they exclude those without power from obtaining political voice. The final feature, really explored by neoliberal thinking beginning with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, is that it absolved us from responsibility to others.
  </p>
  <p>
  This feature is rooted in economics. Whereas Hobbes and Locke created political projects of government, the mid-20th Century thinkers of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman produced political projects of economics. Economics had, for a while, had some physics envy. Physics was based in fundamental rules, which were translated into rigorous mathematical statements which could be deductively proved. There was nothing soft or qualitative about physics. Economics, on the other hand, had been entrenched in political, material, and sociological questions; it was a humanities rather than a hard science. And so a major project in the 1900s was to fix this problem. Economists worked hard to make economics about mathematical rules and models, and to do this they had to excize all of the soft, qualitiative (feminine) things from it. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Since physics is based on assumptions-turned-mathematical rules, economists did the same thing. The place to look for basic rules about economics was individualism. In particular, economists quantified the ideology of the rational, self-interested, isolated individual into their mathematical rules. So not only had selfishness become naturalized through individualism, it had been quantified within economics. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Liberalism is the term for the individualistic ideology created by John Locke, and others (every US president has been a "Liberal"). Some people sought to use the more quantified economics to help create governmental institutions, this would be the post-war Keynesian ideology and the New Deal (where there were some gains of some disenfranchised people). But this ideology was a compromise between the liberal capitalists and working-class socialists at the time, and many people felt like this was a betrayal of the "freedom" found within liberalism's individualistic ideology. Hayek was a central such figure and helped create the Neo-liberals, and he worked to create a neo-liberal economic ideology which centralized the Free Market as the "State of Nature" through which individuals experienced perfect liberty.
  </p>
  <p>
  Since this free market ideology was fundamentally based in mathematical assumptions about human nature being selfishly motivated, and a healthy free market became the goal of this economics, the responsibility for everyone turned into being good agents in the free market. This meant that people needed to be responsible for themselves as self-interested, isolated individuals. And so we see a major feature of individualism realized within neoliberal ideology: You are not responsible for the well-being of anyone else; you are not culpible for the pain of others if you did not directly intend to harm them.
  </p>
  <p>
  Neoliberal ideology is the centralizing for of the Reagan-Thatcher years, and has been dominant on both sides of the aisle since. Thatcher sussinctly located individualism as central to this when she said "There is no such thing as society, only the individual". With this mindset, it becomes absurd to correct racist policies which do not explicitly exclude black Americans. Instead, the best thing you can do with this form of individualism is be color-blind. Black people do not exist as a community, there are only individuals who are black. This means that black Americans were not able to speak collectively against policies which excluded or targeted them, such as the very active War on Drugs and the prison industrial complex which were emboldened by neoliberal ideology.
  </p>
  <p>
  One thing to point out is that no physicist would say that Cells or the Human Body do not exist. Even though, theoretically, we might be able to reduce such behavior to physics, it's not something we can actually do. We need biologists and doctors to recognize these "societies" of individual particles for what they are and to make decisions based on these wholes. It would be absurd to cure cancer by only looking at particle physics; that'd be a good way to die. But neo-classical economics does the economic equivalent of this.
  <p>
  Neoliberalism has not only allowed for hierarchies to persist and those in power to retain it, but has created greater inequality than any time in US history. It has also created a brand new wave of colonialism and vastly expanded inequality at a national level as well. Furthermore, since it is based in economics which has nothing but mathematical models constructed considering only selfish individuals, it has allowed for the environmental impacts of economics to compound into an existential threat to all of human society. I guess it's a good thing that society doesn't exist, or else it'd be in trouble!
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>
  I feel like individualism is something we all are taught, and is present within almost every aspect of culture we consume. It is the air that we breathe, and so we continue to make decisions based off of reasoning based in individualism. And this is harmful, as individualism is designed as a way to justify inequality and so silence the voices of those who are harmed by the resulting hierarchies.
  </p>
  <p>
  I encourage you to identify thinking within yourself which is based in individualistic thinking and to just question how you might think about things differently. But the most radical thing we can do is make the collective voices of communities harmed by individualistic ideologies heard in a meaningful way. Immigrants. Black Americans. Indigenous People. LGBTQ+ people. Workers. The poor. Women. Colonized people. But not just people either, we should challenge the Cartesian duality at the heart of individualism even more by ridding ourselves of things like the culture/nature binary. Make the voices of birds, trees, forests, rocks, rivers, the atmosphere heard as political and collective entities. Unless we have all of these things as central objects of consideration within our political philosophies, rather than just individual humans, then inequality will continue to grow and kill and climate change will only become more of a threat.
