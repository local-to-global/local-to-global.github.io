  We can think of the changes in our political, social, and economic systems throughout history as changes in our relationships to land. The story typically goes that humans became humans through a transition from tree-dwelling to land dwelling, which transformed into hunter-gatherer social groups - who take advantage of the local land and its inhabitants to obtain food collectively. The real jump to civilization, so it is said, was the advent of agriculture where we actively cultivated the land and domesticated wildlife to fulfuill our needs. Since this allows for towns and politics, this is usually where the story about land stops and the talk of civilization begins. But the story doesn't stop there, and we shouldn't think of this step as a divergence between nature and culture, but as a transformation of the relationship between nature and culture.

  In Europe, towns with their surrounding agriculture eventually produced a feudal relationship to land. In this way, there were Lords who lived in castles and towns who governed the local land, and then serfs who worked the land. Part of the fruits of the serf labor was given to the Lords and the wealthy, and the rest was used as a subsistent means of production. That is, as long as the serfs produced what the Lord demanded, the remainder of the land and their time would go into ensuring that the land produced food to feed the local serf population. In this system, land was viewed as a commons - a place whose resources and space was shared among the inhabitants - under control of the Feudal lord.

  This piecemeal distribution of commons under the lords is a fundamental component of Feudalism. It defined the standings of lords and serfs through how they interacted with the commons. The lords oversaw and managed the lands and collected a share of the goods produced on it. The serfs worked the land under the direction of the lords and paid for their right to subsist on the land by giving the lords part of the crops. 
  </p>

  The transition out of Feudalism and into the proto-Capitalism of the enlightenment is marked by a transition in how we relate to land. This is the period of enclosure; the process of the commons being divided up and sold to private land owners. Serfs could no longer subsist off of their land, instead they had to become paid workers of the land owners. The yields of these crops were then the property of the land owner, who could sell it elsewhere and use this to pay the workers who, themselves, could pay for food. This allowed for a few things. Firstly higher productive practices. Secondly, cities.
