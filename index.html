    <div class="post-description">Is dividing by zero really that tabboo? We'll address how division by zero can actually work out, by wrapping up the number line into a circle. Additionally, we'll provide a rigorous setting that allows for division by zero that can be generalized into higher dimensions.</div>

    <div class="post-date">5/08/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Pi seems to pop up in a lot places where you wouldn't really expect it to. We'll take a look at some of the more famous examples of this, and provide a heuristic that allows us to see why it should appear in these formulas. This heuristic is based off of transfering properties of polynomials to complex values differentiable functions. In particular, we'll see that pi pops up in these contexts for exactly the same reason.</div>

    <div class="post-date">5/15/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Euler's formula is a mysterious relationship between pi, e and i that can seem unintuitive. Many proofs are just proofs that it is true, rather than explorations on why it is true. Furthermore, most proofs rely on confusing visuals or properties of functions that are too abstract to be intuitive for the curious student that happens upon Euler's Formula. We'll give a "why" for Euler's formula and, more generally, see how trigonometry naturally pops up when you try to talk about raising numbers to complex powers.</div>
