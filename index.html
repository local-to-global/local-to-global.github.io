    <div class="post-description"> While any class in Galois theory will discuss solving polynomials, and maybe even go into how to best obtain formulas for degrees 2,3,4, there are usually a couple of things missing in this narrative. One point that is glossed over is that plugging in values for arbitrary coefficients actually works and, moreover, that Galois information about the plugged in equation can be inferred from the case with arbitrary coefficients. Another thing that is rarely discussed is what happens when we have a conflicting characteristic. That is, what happens when the characteristic is less than the degree? These are two points that are actually linked and will be discussed.</div>

    <div class="post-description">Most people know the quadratic equation, and maybe even a few ways to derive it or thing about it. Another way to think about it is presented that is motivated by a number theory-esque interpretation of a square root and how we manipulate equations with unknowns to take advantage of what is already know. </div>
