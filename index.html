    <div class="post-date">5/31/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">The definition of the derivative that we learn in school is motivated geometrically through secant lines. While this is geometrically nice, it does little to emphasize the main purpose of derivatives: Approximation. We'll look at an equivalent way to define derivatives by trying to understand what we mean when we say that "The Tangent Line best approximates the function at a point" From this "best approximating line", we'll be able to recover the ordinary definition of the derivative. From there we can investigate higher order derivatives and see how Taylor polynomials have a natural interpretation in terms of approximation.</div>

    <div class="post-date">5/27/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Fermat's Last Theorem can be proved, once we have proved some other deep theorems. These theorems, however, can seem pretty unrelated to the statement of Fermat's Last Theorem. We'll discuss how to prove Fermat's Last Theorem assuming these deep results. We'll see how to prove Fermat's Last Theorem from the ABC-Conjecture, Serre's Conjecture and the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. This post will be a bit higher level than some others.</div>

    <div class="post-date">5/20/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">The Gaussian Integral appears in various different contexts, from physics to probability to number theory. It can be surprising to find that its value relates to pi. It turns out that there is a much more concrete reason for why we can expect this integral to be related to pi, and it has to do with the properties of the function $f(x)=e^{x^2}$.</div>

    <div class="post-date">5/15/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Is dividing by zero really that taboo? We'll address how division by zero can actually work out, by wrapping up the number line into a circle. Additionally, we'll provide a rigorous setting that allows for division by zero that can be generalized into higher dimensions.</div>

    <div class="post-title"> <a href="piFormulas.html">Why is Pi in so many surprising formulas?</a></div>
    <div class="post-date">5/08/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Pi seems to pop up in a lot places where you wouldn't really expect it to. We'll take a look at some of the more famous examples of this, and provide a heuristic that allows us to see why it should appear in these formulas. This heuristic is based off of transfering properties of polynomials to complex values differentiable functions. In particular, we'll see that pi pops up in these contexts for exactly the same reason.</div>

    <div class="post-title">  <a href="complexExp.html">Complex Exponents and Euler's Formula.</a></div>
    <div class="post-date">5/01/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Euler's formula is a mysterious relationship between pi, e and i that can seem unintuitive. Many proofs are just proofs that it is true, rather than explorations on why it is true. Furthermore, most proofs rely on confusing visuals or properties of functions that are too abstract to be intuitive for the curious student that happens upon Euler's Formula. We'll give a "why" for Euler's formula and, more generally, see how trigonometry naturally pops up when you try to talk about raising numbers to complex powers.</div>

    <div class="post-date">4/22/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Everyone knows that exponentiation is "repeated multiplication". But this only makes sense when the power is a positive integer. What do expressions like $A^{-4}$ or $A^{5/3}$ or $A^{\pi}$ mean? And why? In this post, we'll start with exponentiation as "repeated multiplication" and investigate the functional properties that make expontiation important in the first place, and then use this as the mechanism to allow us to make sense of powers that are not positive integers.</div>

    <div class="post-date">4/10/2017</div>
    <div class="post-description">Visualization of each of the terms in Singular Value Decompositino is a good way to be introduced to the concept. But this can be limiting. In this post we will investigate how a mathematician would view Singular Value Decomposition and find that it is a story on how linear functions necessarily break up spaces and how they fit together through function composition, all wrapped up in the power of the Spectral Theorem which gives many nice results about eigenvalues and eigendecompositions.</div>
