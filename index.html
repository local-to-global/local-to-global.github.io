    <div class="post-description">The formal Epsilon-Delta definition of a limit can be intimidating. It's a complicated statement, confusing and you mostly just have to do one or two problems for it on an exam and then never worry about it again. But it doesn't have to  be, when put in the proper setting it can be interesting, useful and intuitive. Limits are only confusing in a setting where the focus is passing a test, which gives a very narrow view of things. While limits are usually taught for the sole purpose of evaluating simple derivative, it is more natural to think of them in the context of approximation and when we look at the problem of approximating values of  functions, limits will naturally pop out.</div>

    <div class="post-description">Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are a huge part of Linear Algebra and other subjects. If you've taken a class in Linear Algebra, you've probably worked with them by trying to compute them after being given a matrix and computing determinants and solving polynomials. But what is really going on? What is the connection between Linear Transformations and polynomials, particularly how does the characteristic polynomial govern what the eigenvalues are, and are there a more sophisticated ideas behind eigenvectors? Why do we know that Linear Transformations will have them to begin with? There are a lot of unanswered questions that are glossed over in standard courses that I hope to explore here.</div>

    <div class="post-description">
      Singular Value Decomposition is a fundamental way to write a linear map $T:V\rightarrow W$ in an easy way. But the descriptions of it can be unhelpful. Sure, they're useful for those who are first learning Linear Algebra, but they don't really teach much about the inner workings of SVD or Linear Algebra. In this we'll explore the actual mechanics of Singular Value Decomposition.</div>
